Starbucks Global Responsibility Report – Goals and Progress 2012

2012 Global Responsibility Report: Year in Review

Each Starbucks is part of the fabric of the neighborhood it serves. Although we are a global 
company with stores across the globe, each interaction is local. Starbucks is a gathering place, a 
place to connect, a barista offering a cup of coffee with an outstretched hand. 

Since our first store in 1971, we have felt a responsibility to make 
a positive impact one person, one cup and one neighborhood at a 
time. As we have grown to now more than 18,000 stores in over 60 
countries, we recognize that commitment to corporate citizenship 
is also a business imperative. We can use our scale for good, and 
catalyze change across entire industries so that Starbucks and 
everyone we touch can endure and thrive.

Unfortunately, many people have disengaged from their 
communities. Although they may desire change, and they may 
want to make a difference, they are often unsure of how and 
where to start. We are working to engage and activate these 
individuals with our Youth Leadership Grants program. Our 
effort now reaches more than 50,000 young people each year, 
creating innovative and positive solutions to local needs while 
empowering young people.

On a global level, we are trying to be innovative in how we 
think about communities. We go beyond the impact of a single 
company, to energize and activate our employees – who we call 
partners – along with our customers, suppliers and nonprofit 
partners. Our annual Global Month of Service is a great example, 
with more than 230,000 hours of service and 2,100 projects 
completed in April 2012, and with plans to expand in new 
directions in 2013. 

We are seeing the impacts of climate change on our planet and 
are working to minimize our own environmental footprint. We are 
also helping our farmers run their businesses in an environmentally 
mindful way, making adjustments to ensure the viability of their 
businesses despite shifting growing conditions.

In 2012, we demonstrated the power that happens when our 
partners and a community come together. We opened our third 
community store in Houston, Texas, and helped a city take hold of 
its own destiny. In the words of one neighbor, “You have changed 
our neighborhood forever. It’s because people see this going on 
and now they will be more likely to take action themselves.”

We know global change ultimately resides in the power of each 
individual. 

At our Farmer Support Centers, we work one-on-one with 
farmers to help them manage their businesses more effectively, 
improve the quality and productivity of their crops, and provide 
social services to their workers. By making these investments 
in human capital, we create ripples of change in thousands of 
farming communities.

Our annual Global Responsibility report is a moment to reflect 
on the impact we’ve made over the past year. But more than 
reporting on past progress, it’s an opportunity to be more 
intentional and focused about what we can do in the future. 
While there are challenges to operating such a complex, 
expanding global business as ours, we will continue to balance 
local relevance with our global reach. You have our commitment 
that we will continue to push ourselves in new ways.  

I invite you to learn more about our 2012 goals and progress 
and welcome your feedback and ideas.

Starbucks Global Responsibility Report – Goals and Progress 2012

Message from Howard Schultz

In business, success is most often measured by numbers. 
Store counts. Revenues. Comps. For Starbucks, these 
metrics are important indications of how we are growing 
our brand and returning value to our shareholders. 

But equally important to the value we create are the values we live by.

We’ve been building a company with a conscience for more than four 
decades, intent on the fair and humane treatment of our people as well as the 
communities where we do business, and the global environment we all share. 
We are proud of our heritage. Yet never before have we seen the marketplace 
and today’s consumers have such a deep interest in and knowledge about 

what companies stand for and how they are living up to their promises. Not only is standing for something beyond 
making a profit the right thing to do, it is the way business must be conducted in the 21st century. Only by doing business 
through the lens of humanity can an organization establish a crucial reservoir of trust with its people and its customers. At 
Starbucks, it is a trust we must earn every day.

For these reasons, we continue to broaden our ethical sourcing programs. Today, we are proud that more than 93% of 
our coffee meets our standard on this front. And through our enhanced sourcing efforts for cocoa, tea and manufactured 
products, we are making a more positive impact than ever before. 

Just as Starbucks does not accept the status quo in our business, and proactively embraces innovative products and ideas, 
we also look for and champion freshinventive ways to use our existing assets and resources beyond business. In 2012, 
we appointed renowned community advocate and entrepreneurial leader Blair Taylor to serve in our newly created role 
of chief community officer. A true visionary, Blair leads our community, partner resources, government relations, diversity 
and global responsibility teams. As a member of Starbucks senior leadership team, he is helping to ensure the company 
continues to make meaningful differences in communities around the world.

Once again, Starbucks is refusing to be a bystander as the world around all of us changes. I would like to take this 
opportunity to extend my heartfelt thanks to our partners, customers, business partners, farmers and suppliers for their 
extraordinary dedication to the hard work and humanity that embodies the spirit of Starbucks. 

Thank you for joining us on the journey.

Warm regards,

Howard Schultz
chairman, president and chief executive officer

Ethical Sourcing

We have taken a holistic approach to ethically sourcing our products – from 
the coffee we serve our customers to the green aprons worn by our baristas. 
We strive to cultivate lasting relationships with the people who grow our 
products and create our manufactured goods as we work together to produce 
high-quality, ethically sourced products.

Our approach includes responsible purchasing practices, farmer support efforts, social responsibility standards for 
suppliers, and environmental programs. We know that our supply chain is vast, and we have an opportunity to use its 
scale to make positive changes industry-wide.

GOALPROGRESSGOALPROGRESSGOALPROGRESSStarbucks Global Responsibility Report – Goals and Progress 2012

The cornerstone of our approach is Coffee and Farmer Equity (C.A.F.E.) Practices, our comprehensive coffee-buying 
program that ensures coffee quality while promoting social, economic and environmental standards. C.A.F.E. 
Practices, which we developed in collaboration with Conservation International (CI) a decade ago, has created 
significant social and economic impacts for more than one million workers, and environmental improvements on the 
thousands of participating farms.

Farms and mills are evaluated using a comprehensive scorecard of more than 200 indicators by third-party 
verification organizations, which are overseen by SCS Global Services. In 2012, 90% of our coffee was C.A.F.E. 
Practices verified.

Purchasing third-party certified or verified coffees not only meets our customers’ expectations, but can also help 
protect the environment and the livelihood of farmers in coffee-growing regions. We have offered Fairtrade coffee 
since 2000, and remain one of the largest purchasers of Fairtrade certified coffee in the world. In 2012, 44.4 million 
pounds (8.1 %) of our coffee purchases were Fairtrade certified. We also purchased 8.7 million pounds (1.6%) of 
certified organic coffee in 2012. 

In 2012, 93 % of our coffee was ethically sourced through C.A.F.E. Practices, Fairtrade and/or other externally verified 
or certified programs, with some coffees receiving multiple verifications or certifications. It is our goal that by 2015, 
100 % of our coffee will be sourced this way. 

Another important component of our approach is a green coffee pricing model that aims to pay the prices premium 
quality commands, while fostering price stability and mutually beneficial relationships with suppliers. Starbucks 
sourced 545 million pounds of premium quality green (unroasted) coffee from 29 countries in 2012, and paid an 
average price of $2.56 per pound. In 2012, 98% of our contracts included an economic transparency clause.

Tea
In a similar way we approach responsible coffee sourcing, we are committed to a long-term strategy of ethical tea 
sourcing, which includes helping support farmers and their communities throughout our tea supply chain. We have 
been working with the Ethical Tea Partnership (ETP) since 2005 to collaborate with others in the tea industry, and to 
make sure that our tea is produced in a socially responsible way. In 2012, we strategically sourced from estates that 
are a part of  the ETP program and subject to third-party independent audit on the social and environmental criteria 
outlined in the ETP Global Standard.

Our work with ETP is complemented by our support of the CHAI (Community Health and Advancement Initiative) 
project with Mercy Corps. In 2012 we celebrated the 10-year anniversary of CHAI. Since 2003 CHAI has directly 
impacted 75,000 people and their families in more than 200 farming communities in India and Guatemala.

Cocoa
Our approach to buying cocoa is also based on a commitment to ensuring a long-term supply of high-quality, 
ethically sourced cocoa while contributing positively to the environment and to cocoa-farming communities. 
Our Cocoa Practices program seeks to verify the supply chain for the cocoa beans used in our beverages, with 
inspections performed by independent verifiers overseen by SCS Global Services. 

Store Merchandise
We’re also committed to social responsibility standards for the merchandise, furniture and other items found in our 
stores. We’ve set strong standards for our suppliers and offer them assistance when corrections need to be made to 
their business practices. Adherence to those standards informs our sourcing decisions and ensures we are working 
with suppliers who share our commitment to ethical sourcing. Our buyers work directly with suppliers, negotiating 
contracts for the products we need in our operations or sell to our customers. 

In 2012 we assessed 128 factories and found that 36 of them failed our zero-tolerance standards. Even though our 
approach is to work with suppliers to correct the issues, there are times when we halt business due to the nature 
of the issues and until adequate resolution takes place. While we were able to implement improvement plans with 
almost half of these factories, we discontinued working with 15 factories as suppliers for standards issues. Since 
starting the program in 2006, we have engaged in more than 500 factory assessments and continue to work with 
more than 70 factories on programs to improve standards.

Reducing Our Environmental Impact

Our comprehensive approach to reducing our environmental impact means 
looking at all aspects of our business, how they intersect, and how we can 
integrate new solutions to create meaningful and sustained change. 

Beyond the proactive efforts within our control, the realities of climate change are a growing challenge, and we felt 
the impact during 2012 – the hottest year on record.  From coffee-growing conditions in Costa Rica to the increased 
electricity needed to power our stores, we need to consider the global impact of our actions. 

By building more energy-efficient stores and facilities, conserving the energy and water we use and purchasing 
renewable energy credits, we are pushing ourselves to reduce the environmental footprint of our business operations. 
We are also working in critical areas of our supply chain to mitigate our impacts and adapt to a changing climate. This 
is to ensure the long-term sustainability of our business and the health of the communities we touch. 

But it’s about more than just our operations and supply chain. We are also working to shrink our environmental 
footprint and meet the expectations of our customers by reducing the waste associated with our cups, increasing 
recycling and incorporating green design into our stores. 

We also know that the magnitude and complexity of addressing climate change requires us to think beyond the 
actions of our own company. As a result we are committed to continue using the power of our voice to champion 
progressive climate policies in partnership with other like-minded businesses and organizations.

LEED Certification
Starbucks has been a leader for more than a decade in the development and implementation of a scalable green 
building program for retail companies like ours. 

We joined the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) in 2001 and collaborated with them to help develop the LEED® 
(Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) for Retail rating system, an effort that incorporated retail business 
strategies into the LEED for  New Construction and Commercial Interiors rating systems. 

We opened our first LEED-certified store in 2005. In 2009 Starbucks became one of the first retailers to join USGBC’s 
LEED Volume Certification pilot program.

As the first retail company to take this building approach globally, we’ve experienced success in some geographic 
areas and challenges in others. In 2012, we built 69 percent of our new global company-owned stores to achieve LEED, 
but had difficulty applying LEED in regions where the program is not as established. Going forward, we will explore 
additional strategies to bring 100% of our stores to a sustainable building standard.

Reducing Waste with Reusable Cups
Reusable cups are an important component of our overall waste reduction strategy. Since 1985 we’ve rewarded our 
customers with a discount when they bring in personal tumblers, and we have a goal to serve 5% of the beverages 
made in our stores in tumblers and mugs brought in by our customers.   

In 2012 customers brought their own tumblers into our stores 35.8 million times, saving more than 1.6 million pounds 
of paper from landfills. Although customers brought in their personal mugs 1.6 million more times in 2012 over 
the previous year, the percentage of customers choosing reusable mugs remained flat from last year.  In previous 
years, we calculated the percentage of customer tumbler use over total transactions.  In collecting data from our 
stores around the world and analyzing customer behavior, we determined that a better measurement of this goal is 
to calculate the percentage of times a personal cup/tumbler is used over our total beverage sales, which is a more 
precise measure of the total beverages we sell.      

We’ll continue to find innovative ways to engage customers to work with us to reduce waste, including launching a 
$1 reusable cup in the U.S. and Canada in 2013 with plans to expand to other markets. We challenge ourselves, our 
partners in our support centers and our stores, to use reusable cups and remain committed to exploring new ways to 
reduce our cup waste.

Forest Conservation
We are concerned about the impacts of climate change, especially in the sensitive bioregions where coffee is grown. 
To better understand the risk to farming communities and our supply chain, we work with Conservation International 
(CI) and farmers in three unique coffee-producing communities. Together we are working to identify and test effective 
strategies for improving the sustainability of coffee production processes, the conservation and restoration of natural 
habitat, and opportunities to facilitate farmer access to forest carbon markets or other forms of assistance. 

In Chiapas, Mexico, we engaged more than 200 farmers in 23 communities and helped them protect 10 species of 
plants in nearly 500,000 hectares in three protected area reserves. Capturing the carbon value of this investment in 
tree plantings has helped farmers receive additional income in the form of payments for carbon credits – creating the 
equivalent of 22 new jobs and representing an average of nearly 27% of a participating farmer’s income.

In Sumatra, Indonesia, we are continually exploring the feasibility of a forest carbon market program with local and 
regional government organizations to lay the groundwork for the future. We are investing in the development of the 
Aceh Tengah Coffee Climate Change Adaption plan, building the first of six nurseries in 2012, organizing climate 
mitigation and adaption trainings for farmers, and establishing plans to plant 300,000 trees by 2013.

We expanded the partnership to the Minas Gerais region in Brazil’s Atlantic Forest for the first time in 2012, and 
distributed 200,000 native tree seedlings to farmers. We are helping farmers gain access to existing government 
programs that provide cash incentives for forest preservation and restoration. We are also conducting research to 
better understand opportunities for improved productivity, increased income and resilience to climate change.

Testing these approaches in different regions helps us refine our strategies so they can be applied to other coffee-
growing communities and replicated by other government and industry partners.

Engaging Youth
As we engage in communities in the present, we are also planning for the future. We’re helping develop the next 
generation of extraordinary leaders through our Youth Action Grants. These investments help young people learn 
the skills required for our changing global economy, such as business savvy, social conscience and collaborative 
communication.

When we created the Youth Action program in 2008, we set an ambitious goal of engaging 50,000 young people 
by 2015. For each of the past three years, we have exceeded this goal. These youth leaders in turn mobilized more 
than 1.8 million hours of community service in 2012 and created ripples of change in communities around the world. 
As we look to the future with our Youth Leadership grants, we hope to help the next generation of leaders to build 
successful and socially responsible businesses and nonprofit organizations.

Community Stores
We are exploring new ways we can be more directly involved with the communities we serve. Our Community Stores 
are helping create engaged citizens through an innovative business model and partnerships. Community Stores 
serve as the hub of our community service and training programs  that promote leadership and job and life-skill 
development.

During fiscal 2012 we opened our first two Community Stores in Harlem, New York, and the Crenshaw community of 
Los Angeles. We opened a third store in Houston, Texas, in early fiscal 2013.  

In the first 12 months of the Community Store program, this effort generated $245,000 for holistic community-
revitalization programs focused on education, safety, housing, health and employment. As we celebrate the first year 
of Community Stores, we are pleased with the personal and financial impacts they have made in these neighborhoods. 
These stores have shed light on the role our stores can play in creating community connection.

Farming Communities
Our commitment to communities extends beyond our stores to include the regions that supply our coffee, tea and 
cocoa. Starbucks invests in programs designed to strengthen local economic and social development. We are working 
collaboratively with nongovernmental organizations that have experience and expertise in working with farming 
communities. 

In addition to social investments, we also support communities through farmer loans and ethical sourcing programs 
with Conservation International and Fairtrade, among others.

In Indonesia’s Aceh province, Starbucks has teamed with Save the Children to improve children’s health and 
education in coffee-growing communities through BLEND (Better Living, Education, Nutrition, and Development).

GOALPROGRESSGOALPROGRESSStarbucks Global Responsibility Report – Goals and Progress 2012

The BLEND project began in 2009. Since that time, it has made a real difference in the lives of children and their 
families from more than 40 communities in the Bener Meriah district. Participating communities have doubled their 
vaccination rates, drastically improved health worker capacity, and quadrupled the number of community health 
posts. Moving forward, our plan is to expand BLEND to other Bener Meriah communities. 

In tea-growing regions of India and botanical-farming communities in Guatemala, Starbucks has helped support 
health and economic development programs through Tazo’s Community Health and Advancement Initiative (CHAI) 
project, a joint partnership with Mercy Corps. Since 2003 Starbucks and Tazo suppliers have contributed $1.1 million 
for CHAI. We are now involved in a three-year project to impact more than 11,000 people with water and sanitation 
improvements, youth engagement, education and income generation.

Since fiscal 2005, Starbucks has helped support the Guatemala Education Initiative, an effort with Save the Children 
to bring education programs to remote coffee-producing villages in that country. In 2011 Starbucks launched a 
three-year project with a $1 million contribution to Save the Children to improve education, health and nutrition for 
coffee-farming families in Guatemala’s Huehuetenango region.

Starbucks also supports water, sanitation and hygiene education programs in water-stressed countries through the 
Starbucks Foundation’s Ethos Water Fund. For each bottle of Ethos® water purchased, a contribution of $.05US 
($.10CN in Canada) is made to the fund. Since 2005 $7.38 million has been granted, benefitting approximately 
430,000 people around the world.  In 2012 two new grants were made in East Africa, an important coffee-growing 
region for Starbucks.  

Giving
The Starbucks Foundation is a separate 501(c)(3) charitable organization that receives funding from Starbucks 
Corporation and private donations. The Foundation gave $13.8 million in 2012, making over 400 grants to nonprofit 
organizations. Grants included $2.3 million for Starbucks Youth Leadership grants and $2 million in origin social 
development grants to Mercy Corps, Save the Children, Ethos Water Fund, PCI (Project Concern International) and 
PATH. 

In 2012 Starbucks Corporation gave $6.5 million in cash, including $1.75 million to the Starbucks Foundation. 
Corporate giving included funding for community-building programs – including the Global Fund through our 
partnership with (RED) ™ and other efforts – and $40 million in in-kind contributions.

Diversity and Inclusion
As our company has grown to reach our neighborhoods and communities around the world, diversity and inclusion 

have become increasingly important to success.  We understand that meeting the needs of the global community 
requires creativity and innovation. We intend to leverage the diversity of thought that our partners, communities and 
suppliers bring to us. 

At Starbucks we strive to create a culture that values and respects diversity and inclusion. We expect to be the leader 
in diversity and inclusion from our partners in the field to our senior leadership teams. To ensure that our goal is 
a reality, starting in 2012 we have integrated diversity and inclusion into the core of our leadership competencies. 
We expect that all leaders within Starbucks practice behaviors that demonstrate inclusion. The new leadership 
competency reads that, as leaders, we will “reach out to leverage diverse points of view, talents and capabilities. 
Work and think across teams, functions and businesses; across markets, channels and organizations; across cultures 
and communities; across physical and digital spaces.”

To strengthen these efforts, we also collaborate with diverse professional organizations, nonprofit organizations, 
businesses, civic leaders and individuals who share our values.

About the 2012 Starbucks 
Responsibility Report

Scope
The report for fiscal 2012 focuses on our performance against the goals we set in 2008 in three areas: ethical sourcing, 
environmental stewardship and community involvement. We’ve also included helpful links to information and 
resources publicly available on Starbucks.com regarding our financial, corporate governance, workplace and diversity 
policies and performance.

In developing this report, we’ve covered topics and issues that are important to Starbucks and our stakeholders, 
based on feedback from sources like MyStarbucksIdea, customer feedback via our Customer Service center 
and industry  analysis conducted by SustainAbility and Edelman, along with direct conversations with the many 
organizations we work with. We share information about those topics in the body of the report or direct readers to 
other resources.

Our report has also been guided by the Global Reporting Initiative G3 Guidelines, a set of internationally recognized 
sustainability reporting standards. These key criteria are outlined in our GRI Index.

A high-level summary of our progress toward our commitments and public goals are contained in our Global 
Responsibility Scorecard 2012.

Boundaries
Our Global Responsibility Report for fiscal year 2012 focuses on the work we are doing in ethical sourcing, community 
involvement and environmental stewardship. These areas are where we can have the greatest impact. We also believe 
they are important to Starbucks, our customers, our partners (employees), non-governmental organizations and 
investors.

We also know wellness and workplace policies are of considerable interest to our stakeholders. Furthermore, we have 
always embraced diversity as an essential component in the way we do business.  We are currently innovating our 
diversity strategy to support our multi-channel, multi-brand global expansion.

While our commitments are global, our report content is focused largely on Starbucks U.S. and Canada company-
owned and operated retail stores and global supply chain operations. Counting by stores, these operations represent 
most of Starbucks social, environmental and economic impacts.  

A notable exception to this is information on total coffee purchases. Here we report for all Starbucks brands and retail 
stores, including Starbucks Coffee, Seattle’s Best Coffee and Torrefazione Italia.

Starbucks has used the Credit360 system for key performance indicators data entry, approval and audit.  This fiscal 
year we’ve started to collect data from company-owned stores globally; we’re in the process of validating and 
improving the processes and information so we can consistently and accurately report against common goals.

Information Integrity
Starbucks management is responsible for the preparation and integrity of the information being reported for fiscal 
2012. Through a system of internal controls, including a comprehensive verification process involving internal subject 
matter experts, we believe this information fairly represents our global responsibility activities and performance results 
for the fiscal year 2012. External verification is provided by Moss Adams LLP. Read the Moss Adams Independent 
Assurance Report. All infographics related to our goal performance are visual representations of progress, and not to 
exact scale.
