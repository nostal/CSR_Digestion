to our stakeholders:
The theme of our 2011 Corporate social responsibility report—
Listen, Learn, act—is founded in the values and vision provided 
by our founder, milton s. hershey, more than a century ago. 
Today, our 13,000 hershey employees around the world are 
bringing great hershey products to millions of consumers while 
making a positive difference in their communities.

In 2011, hershey delivered another strong year, posting net sales 
above $6 billion for the first time. While building on our leader-
ship in north america, we invested in new international markets. 
We introduced hershey products to new customers and consum-
ers in new regions of the world. We worked more closely with 
suppliers across our entire value chain, and we strengthened and  
reissued our supplier code of conduct.

Fundamentally, hershey is a knowledge-based company, and we 
are leveraging our core skills and capabilities to broaden our 
understanding of global Csr trends. 

For example, we recently assessed long-term global consumer 
trends in all key regions of the world. significantly, consumers—
whether in the United states, Brazil or China—are committed  
to giving back as individuals and to buying products from 
companies that they view as socially and environmentally 
responsible. We believe that this trend will only accelerate. For 
The hershey Company, that means, first and foremost, assuring 
our customers and consumers that our high-quality products are 
produced in a manner consistent with the global Csr approach 
described in this report.

I am confident that hershey’s Csr strategy will help support  
and advance our growing global business. It is based on our 
values, aligned with our culture, focused on partnerships,  
open to change and evaluated through continuous  
improvement measures. 

hershey is a caring and compassionate company. During a time 
of economic difficulty, individual employee and retiree giving  
to the United Way in 2011 reached a record $1.3 million. 
Including The hershey Company contribution, we gave more 
than $2 million to this organization, which we have supported 
for nearly 80 years.

Like so many of the outstanding agencies that we partner with 
on social issues, we expect to see that our contributions are 
resulting in measurable change. That’s why we closely track and 
communicate the results of our social investments. These are 
summarized in the Csr scorecards that we update annually. 

West africa is a region of continuing focus for our company. It  
is where we source the majority of hershey cocoa—our most 
important commodity. We understand that improving sustain-
able cocoa farming practices leads to better lives for cocoa 
farmers and their families. hershey is continuously evaluating the 
numerous programs—in agriculture, education and health— 
that we are supporting. recently, we have expanded our com-
mitment to cocoa communities in West africa through a  
five-year, $10 million investment in innovative sustainability and 
sourcing initiatives. 

We have demonstrated much progress in our 2011 Csr report. 
We are operating our global business based on our Csr prin-
ciples. Today, our employees are engaged and motivated by their 
involvement in our Csr initiatives. our business partners know 
that hershey will always operate in a socially and environmentally 
responsible way.

our commitment to Csr is already yielding powerful results. as 
we move into new markets and expand our leadership in north 
america, I am convinced that our values and heritage will be 
fundamental to our continuing success.

Chief Executive Officer

to our stakeholders:
I am a proud ambassador for The hershey Company because I 
passionately believe that we exemplify the hershey values in all 
of our global business operations. 

each day, I see evidence of hershey employees incorporating 
the vision and values of our founder, milton s. hershey, into  
a sophisticated, successful and compassionate company. It is 
how we make and market our products, engage our talented 
employees and drive innovation in everything we do. 

Building our 2011 Corporate social responsibility report from 
the perspective of hershey stakeholders is the right approach. 
In a word, hershey cares. 

The issues that we are addressing—such as human rights, 
climate change and resource scarcity—are global in scope and 
complex in nature. They require that we listen, learn and act. 
The hershey management team has recognized the need for us 
to be proactive in understanding and addressing the needs of 
our neighbors wherever we do business. as this report demon-
strates, hershey is making significant progress in achieving its 
Csr goals and building a sustainable platform for growth. 

The Board of Directors of The hershey Company understands 
that hershey’s unique heritage and strong sense of values 
provide the foundation for our growing global business. In fact, 
we hold ourselves accountable for ensuring hershey sustain-
ability. We have considered creating a separate Csr board 
committee, but have come to the view that social responsibility 
is so integral to The hershey Company that responsibility and 
oversight for it best sits with the Board of Directors. 

In my view, this is an appropriate response. responsible 
sourcing, talent management and resource management are 
core to our continuing business success and fundamental to 
our Csr strategy. our ability to manage them well can mean 
the difference between success or failure in the marketplace. 

accordingly, the Board of Directors is responsible for under-
standing these issues, their impact on stakeholders and  
management’s approach to addressing them—whether imple-
menting energy-efficient technologies, building a program to 
audit suppliers or investing millions to improve cocoa-farming 
practices in West africa. While we have complete confidence in 
our management team’s ability to appropriately address these 
issues, we have an obligation to raise difficult issues, ask hard 
questions and expect continuing progress. Bringing a long- 
term perspective is essential. some decisions won’t yield an 
immediate financial payback but are necessary to ensuring our 
future growth. 

This is an exciting time for The hershey Company. We have a 
portfolio of world-class confectionery products; a talented and 
experienced management team; a revitalized business strategy; 
and an energized, aware and engaged workforce. The hershey 
employees I know are passionate about delivering great 
products and giving back to their communities. This report is 
their story.

our heritage
hershey’s heritage of commitment to and 
engagement with consumers, communi-
ties and children began with the founding 
of our company by milton s. hershey, 
who established the essential principles 
for the conduct of the business:
•  make a high-quality product and sell  
it at a fair price

•  provide meaningful work and fair  
wages to employees

•  give back to the communities where  
the company operates

•   be a good steward of the land and  
its resources

mr. hershey and his wife Catherine lived 
their principles. In 1909, they established 
the hershey Industrial school for orphans, 
known today as milton hershey school, 
and in 1918, milton hershey put his 
personal fortune of $60 million in trust 
for the school. still today The hershey 
Company’s largest shareholder, The 
hershey Trust Company continues to 
administer the school, which provides 
housing, education and medical care, at 
no cost, to more than 1,800 disadvan-
taged children. In fact, because a portion 
of hershey’s profits serves the school, 
every purchase of a hershey’s® product 
indirectly benefits milton hershey school.
even during the great Depression, milton 
hershey invested heavily in developing 
the infrastructure, economy and commu-

nity life of hershey, pennsylvania, and  
the surrounding areas. To ensure that his 
fortune would be put to good use long 
after he was gone, he set up three 
separate trusts under an umbrella organi-
zation, The hershey Trust Company.  
over the decades, these trusts have 
continued milton hershey’s good works, 
benefiting institutions such as the milton 
s. hershey medical Center at The 
pennsylvania state University and penn 
state Children’s hospital.
Today, as we operate in an increasingly 
interconnected global marketplace,  
we are building on mr. hershey’s legacy 
by engaging a wide variety of stakehold-
ers on the most important issues affect-
ing them, as well as our operations and 
our future.

New ventures and acquisitions

In February 2011, Hershey acquired a minority 
stake in Mix1, a company based in Boulder, 
Colorado, that promotes athletic performance 
and overall health through all-natural protein 
shakes and lean performance drinks.

In addition, in December 2011, Hershey 
announced its agreement to acquire Canadian 
chocolate confectionery company Brookside 
Foods, which makes great-tasting products 
based on a unique, patented formula for 
making chocolate-covered fruit juice pieces. 
The company also makes traditional chocolate-
covered nuts and dried fruit. The products, 
which are sold primarily in the United States 
and Canada, are made at two facilities in 
British Columbia and Quebec. Hershey 
completed the acquisition on January 17, 2012.

performance through engagement
As our markets and our stakeholders’ expecta-
tions evolve, we continue to develop and refine 
our approach to managing our key environ-
mental, social and governance issues. To guide 
and focus our efforts, we continuously engage 
the full range of our stakeholders to ensure 
that we understand their current perspectives 
and priorities. We regularly monitor the issues 
that are most important to our brand, our  
success and our responsibilities. We refer to 
these issues as our engagement priorities.

ngos—remarked on hershey’s sourcing 
practices and called for certification of 
cocoa and palm oil. We took their 
comments into account in determining 
our engagement priorities.

hershey’s management reviewed the 
results of the stakeholder review and 
company survey to arrive at the following 
list of issue categories, from which we 
defined our engagement priorities:

hershey also surveyed a broad variety of 
sources in an effort to better understand 
the issues of importance to stakeholders. 
These included investor and customer 
inquiries, questionnaires from respected 
ratings and rankings organizations, and 
employee comments and surveys.

This engagement is a key step in the 
analysis that we undertook in early 2011, 
as part of our strategic planning process, 
to identify areas of key risk and opportu-
nity (sometimes referred to as material 
issues) and to refine and confirm hershey’s 
strategic approach and priorities. This 
analysis considered views of both external 
and internal stakeholders and helped us 
to identify and prioritize those issues that 
are most important to stakeholders from 
an economic, financial, environmental or 

Ethical sourcing: understanding and 
addressing human rights, workplace, 
safety and environmental issues through-
out our supply chain; farmer livelihoods; 
third-party certification of raw materials; 
and ongoing development of our supplier 
code of conduct.

Global competitiveness: issues related 
to our ability to grow and remain com-
petitive internationally in developing 
markets as well as those in which we have 
a longstanding presence; long-term 
strategic planning; and overall manage-
ment quality.

Talent management: issues related to 
attracting and retaining employees, 
including professional development, 
succession planning, training, and 
diversity and inclusion.

 Child labor: issues related to child labor 
on supplier farms (including forced labor, 
trafficked labor and work instead of 
education).

Food safety: programs, policies and 
procedures that assure safety of incoming 
materials, manufacturing environment 
and processes and finished products.

Consumer health: health and wellness, 
obesity, healthy kids, nutrition, active 
living, ingredients.

While many of these issues (such as 
ethical sourcing, sustainable agriculture 
and child labor) are interrelated and 
interdependent, we may address them 
separately from an operational and 
management oversight standpoint.

We will continue to engage directly  
with stakeholders going forward to better 
understand their views and our perfor-
mance. In addition, we are developing 
mechanisms for measuring and monitor-
ing our progress in addressing our 
engagement priorities. We will refine  
this analysis again in 2013.

our strategy for engagement
hershey’s business strategy calls for a deep understanding 
of the needs of our customers, consumers and other stake-
holders in each of our markets around the world. more and 
more, our stakeholders are expressing a growing desire to 
know that the products we make and sell are produced in an 
environmentally and socially responsible manner. our efforts 
to understand and improve our environmental, social and 
governance performance supports our corporate strategy 
by providing the context and focus for driving continuous 
improvement that considers stakeholder interests and ensures 
the company’s long-term success.

Communities and 
local governments
By making communi-
ties where we live and 
work better, we gain 
their support to 
enable our success. 
Many of our employ-
ees volunteer in their 
communities. Hershey 
employees participate 
on community and 
local government 
boards and commit-
tees. Company 
representatives meet 
with community 
leaders to discuss 
business and commu-
nity planning.

Nongovernmental 
organizations 

We are members of 
organizations that 
work to address issues 
of concern to our 
industry and our 
stakeholders, such as 
the World Cocoa 
Foundation, the 
International Cocoa 
Initiative and the 
Healthy Weight 
Commitment 
Foundation. We fund 
many organizations 
that align with the 
causes we support, as 
outlined in our 
Community section.

Policy makers 

We strive to positively 
impact public policy 
and regulation 
through constructive 
engagement with 
government agencies. 
We contribute 
expertise to regula-
tors for industry task 
forces. We comment 
on proposed regula-
tions through our 
Government Relations 
group. We submit 
compliance reports to 
a number of regula-
tors, interest groups 
and NGOs. We bring 
focus, credibility and 
resources to organiza-
tions that help further 
our interests as a 
responsible company. 

Our stakeholders

Consumers

Employees 

Investors 

Providing an appro-
priate return to 
investors allows us  
the freedom to satisfy 
other stakeholders.  
As a publicly traded 
company, we issue 
updates on our 
financial performance 
in our regulatory 
filings. Our Investor 
Relations department 
answers investor 
inquiries. We present 
information to 
investors and  
analysts in quarterly 
analyst calls and at 
conferences.

Our success depends 
on the trust consum-
ers place in us. We 
invest in market 
research to develop 
insights about 
consumers’ prefer-
ences and habits. Our 
Consumer Relations 
department answers 
inquiries from 
consumers that we 
receive through our 
website or the toll 
free number found on 
all of our packaging.

Satisfied and engaged 
employees make 
better business 
decisions. We use 
employee surveys and 
focus groups to learn 
about employee issues 
and employee 
engagement. Senior 
leaders provide 
business updates to 
employees through 
communications  
such as town hall 
meetings, video, e-mail 
and newsletters.

When we published our first CSR report, we 
solicited comments from readers. Many of those 
who responded—among them parents, teachers 
and NGOs—remarked on Hershey’s sourcing 
practices and called for certification of cocoa and 
palm oil. We took their comments into account in 
determining our engagement priorities.

Business partners 

We are part of a 
complex network of 
interdependent 
companies, including 
customers and 
suppliers of raw 
materials, intermedi-
ates and technology. 
Our progress on CSR 
priorities requires 
coordination with our 
business partners. We 
participate in industry 
groups such as the 
National Confection-
ers Association (NCA)

deeply into the issues we know to be  
most important to our stakeholders and, 
accordingly, our company. We have 
identified priority areas and have created 
measurable targets to track improvements 
over time in each of these areas. In 2010, 
we built on our original targets and set 
additional goals, which we discuss in  
this report.

“ To attract and retain the best talent, The 
Hershey Company must be known as a great

the Hershey value chain

The hershey Company’s value chain extends from the nearly 
10,000 suppliers who provide raw materials and process key 
ingredients for our products, to the customers who sell our 
products, to the consumers who enjoy them. It should come  
as no surprise, then, that four of our engagement priorities 
come under the category of marketplace, which encompasses 
our relationships with each person and entity along that value 
chain. These engagement priorities are: responsible sourcing, 
child and forced labor, food safety and consumer health.

In the following sections, we discuss our engagement priorities 
and what we’re doing, whether internally or in partnership 
with others, to develop solutions that deliver enduring value to 
all affected stakeholders and, in turn, our company.

our approach to managing marketplace performance
engaging with stakeholders throughout our value chain
The issues of greatest concern to our suppliers, customers, 
consumers and company—what we call our engagement 
priorities—are varied and complex. several of these, such as 
responsible sourcing and sustainable agriculture, require 
consideration and collaboration across several functional areas 
within our company. These include research and development, 
procurement, enterprise risk management, commodities risk 
management, marketing, quality control and consumer affairs, 
among others.

We interact with a variety of stakeholder groups on our market-
place engagement priorities. These groups include, for example, 
cocoa farmers and their communities, grocers, large retailers, 
parents and consumer groups, pension fund managers, govern-
ments, and both partner and activist nongovernmental organiza-
tions. The interests of these stakeholders are diverse and, at 
times, competing. We engage with some of these groups, such 
as investors and customers, directly and with others through 
industry groups.

A better way to test for Salmonella

Research and Services 
team joined forces 
with Hershey’s Qual-
ity and Regulatory 
Compliance team to 
evaluate methodolo-
gies that would meet 
this dual challenge. 
The teams identified 
two testing methods 

that, when combined, 
allowed for an in-
crease in the number 
of samples tested by 
50 percent, reduced 
response times by 35 
percent and reduced 
the number of false 
positives tested to 
zero in 2011.

Hershey wanted to 
improve response 
times and sensitiv-
ity in testing for the 
presence of Salmo-
nella in ingredients,

product quality and safety
as a company and a brand, hershey is 
synonymous with food products of the 
highest quality—treats that can be 
trusted to be as safe and wholesome as 
they are enjoyable. our quality-assurance 
systems and processes, second to none, 
are carefully monitored and rigorously 
enforced not only in our wholly owned 
and joint-venture manufacturing plants, 
but also among our more than 60 third-
party manufacturing partners and 
hundreds of suppliers worldwide. all 
must adhere to hershey’s high standards 
of excellence.
We have committed substantial resources 
to and have attained global Food safety 
Initiative (i.e., safe Quality Foods 2000 
Level 3) certification at 11 wholly owned 
manufacturing facilities and 1 joint-venture 
facility. plans are in place to have the others 
certified within the next two years.
The hershey Company also utilizes 
qualified third-party manufacturers and 
co-packers
•  to pilot products;

•   to relieve capacity constraints in our current 
wholly owned facilities;

•  for small-volume runs;

•  when unique technology is needed that we 
currently do not possess; and

•  when ingredient cross-contamination is an 
issue (e.g., peanut-free lines).

These partners, as well as ingredient and 
packaging suppliers, are held to hershey’s 
high standards for product safety and 
quality and must agree to our supplier 
code of conduct. many have attained or 
are working towards certification as a 
condition of future business. as a result of 
all of these efforts, The hershey Company 
had no product recalls in 2011. 
We work continuously to strengthen our 
programs, share information with others 
in the food industry and stay at the 
forefront of industry best practices. For 
example, we recently expanded our 
salmonella testing program using 
technology that allows for increased 
testing while providing more rapid results. 

hershey’s Quality assurance and 
Laboratory professionals are active in 
trade organization scientific and 
regulatory committees. our focus since 
2010 is on preparing our manufacturing 
facilities to comply with the U.s. Food 
safety modernization act.

All of our products undergo extensive testing 
to ensure that they meet our own high stan-
dards for superior quality, consistency and 
taste, and absolute safety. We have a zero-
tolerance policy for the presence of hormones 
in our agricultural raw materials, and we  
test cocoa and other raw-materials for the 
presence of heavy metals, pesticides and other 
unacceptable materials. Hershey had no  
recalls in 2011. 

“ From the corporate offices to the factory 
floor, Hershey employees are resolute in 
their commitment to assure consumer safety 
and protect the reputation of our brands.”
 — Don Mastrorocco, Vice President of  
Quality & Regulatory Compliance

promoting happiness through well-being

as a food company that makes and sells 
chocolate and confections, hershey has a 
distinct role and responsibility in promoting 
balanced lifestyles. our ongoing research 
regarding consumer needs and preferences 
shows that people in many markets are 
concerned with making balanced lifestyle 
choices, from eating to physical activity and 
weight control.

our investment in consumer health 
includes ongoing nutrition research and 
the development of new products that 
capitalize on recent findings about the 
health benefits of chocolate and cocoa. 
We are a long-time supporter of physical 
activity programs, especially those that 
involve children. We’ve also developed a 
comprehensive strategy for raising aware-
ness—among both employees and others 
who enjoy our products—of the benefits 
of a lifestyle of moderation and how 
hershey products can play a positive  
role in it. 

a connecting thread:  
the Hershey Center for Health & nutrition®
established in 2006, the hershey Center for health & nutrition®, 
or hChn, sponsors and collaborates with other institutions 
through research on the impact of cocoa, chocolate and nuts on 
cardiovascular health, weight management, cognitive function 
and exercise stamina. hChn, which focuses on studying the 
chemistry and dietary components of these foods that are key 
sources of nutrients, communicates its research findings to  
other scientific organizations, health professionals and associa-
tions such as the academy of nutrition and Dietetics and the 
american heart association.

hChn’s outreach and awareness efforts range from international 
scientific conferences to informational appearances at local health 
fairs and schools. In 2009, hChn launched a website to help 
educate consumers and health professionals on the benefits of 
cocoa, chocolate, nuts and other snacks and the benefits of eating 
a variety of foods in moderation.

In addition, over the past five years hChn has published more 
than 20 scientific papers and four book chapters on such topics as 
flavanol antioxidants in commercially available chocolates, and 
clinical studies on the consumption of cocoa and dark chocolate.

providing information and resources  
for making balanced choices
Today’s consumers want to make informed 
choices about what they eat, and we are 
committed to providing clear information 
regarding our products’ nutritional values 
and ingredients. In our marketing and 
other communications, we frequently 
emphasize the benefits of enjoying 
chocolate and confections in moderation, 
as part of balanced lifestyle. We also share 
our research findings on the health 
benefits of chocolate with our consumers.

We are also committed to marketing  
our products responsibly. For example,  
we were the first food company to make  
a global commitment not to advertise  
to children under 12 years of age in the 
United states. our global marketing 
principles, which guide us in our efforts  
to market our products responsibly, cover 
all marketing techniques.

Hershey’s® track & field games
In 2011, we celebrated the 34th birthday of hershey’s® Track & 
Field games, the largest program of its kind in north america, and 
saw more than 132,000 young people participate in 1,025 meets. 
Free of cost to all entrants, the games provide an easy and fun way 
for kids ages 9–14 to get active and learn about the importance of 
living a balanced lifestyle. more than 10 million youth athletes have 
participated in the games since their inception, including several 
eventual olympic athletes.

Last year we also teamed up with the nike reuse-a-shoe program 
by inviting games participants to bring used athletic shoes to be 
recycled into nike grind, a material used in creating athletic and 
playground surfaces, as well as select nike products. more than 
3,000 shoes were donated to nike’s program over the year. since 
its inception in the early 1990’s, nike’s reuse-a-shoe program has 
recycled more than 25 million pairs of athletic shoes into nike 
grind. In 2011, hershey and nike also partnered to build and 
donate a new playground using a nike grind surface for a commu-
nity in ogden, Utah.

Healthy Weight Commitment foundation
In may 2010, we announced our founding membership, along 
with 15 other food manufacturing companies, in the healthy 
Weight Commitment Foundation. In alliance with the partnership 
for a healthier america, the healthy Weight Commitment 
Foundation has pledged to help consumers reduce their caloric 
intake by introducing lower-calorie product choices, changing 
product recipes where possible to lower the calorie count of 
current products and/or reducing portion sizes of existing single-
serve products.

In 2011, hershey joined with the healthy Weight Commitment 
Foundation to promote Together Counts, a program that chal-
lenges families to eat together and share in physical activity. The 
campaign is based on the idea that balancing diet and exercise is 
more effective and sustainable when families make the commit-
ment together.

The Together Counts website provides meal suggestions, fun 
family activities, helpful tips and more. hershey employees are 
encouraged to take the family pledge and demonstrate that, as a 
company, we are committed to health and wellness.

	Together Counts

•  64% agreed that Hershey’s® chocolates can

experts, the American Council on Exercise and 
the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, the 
campaign offers balanced eating tips, recipes, 
practical solutions for daily activity and play,  
and strategies for work-life fit.

Consumers who engaged in the 2011 campaign

responsible sourcing

This incident led us to review and 
strengthen our supplier code of conduct, 
first released in 2009. We released the 
revised code in December 2011.

We are committed to attaining a deep 
understanding of our supply-chain risks 
and impacts—in particular with regard to 
human rights, product safety and 
environmental issues—in order to give 
preference to those suppliers who 
perform well in these areas. We are 
undertaking internal risk analysis and 
supplier audits, reviewing supplier 
self-assessments, identifying high-risk 
suppliers and devising remediation plans 
to improve their performance. To assist  
in this effort, hershey engages with 
qualified third parties such as the sup-
plier ethical Data exchange (sedex), 
which hershey joined in 2011, and 
aIm-progress, which hershey joined  
in 2011. Both of these organizations 
work to raise awareness of, and help  
companies effectively address,  
supply-chain performance.

In addition, in 2011 we created two 
positions within our global sourcing area 
dedicated to responsible sourcing.

We source from approximately 10,000 
suppliers around the world. We have 
always taken a collaborative approach  
to responsible sourcing, working with 
suppliers and peer companies to exchange 
best practices, ideas and, in recent years, 
information on responsible sourcing and 
sustainable supply-chain management. 
We have come to understand that, more 
and more, our performance on many of 
our engagement priorities is a reflection 
of both our own behavior and that of  
our suppliers.

as a recent example, in 2011, hershey 
was criticized for conditions related to 
the J-1 visa program sponsored by one of 
its suppliers at a packaging plant near 
hershey, pennsylvania (The J-1 visa 
program is a visitor exchange program 
run by the U.s. Department of state). 
While the facility was neither owned nor 
operated by The hershey Company and 
the employees enrolled in the J-1 pro-
gram were not employees of The her-
shey Company, the fact that the issue 
involved a supplier facility in which 
hershey products were packaged 
nevertheless reflected on The hershey 
Company itself. When we learned of the 
issue, we worked with the supplier to 
remediate the issue, and we offered the 
students local tours and a stipend 
amounting to a week’s pay in an effort to 
provide some of the cultural experience 
that the students had been seeking 
through the program.

our stakeholder groups. It requires 
investment and collaboration with our 
peers, our suppliers, ngos, governments 

even with all of us working together, the 
pace of change is slower than any of us 
want it to be. That’s why we have stepped 
up our efforts, investing $10 million over 
the next five years in programs designed 
to improve farming practices and raise 
standards of living among farmers while 
promoting ethical labor practices, educa-
tional opportunities and socioeconomic 
growth in their communities.

The issues surrounding the responsible 
sourcing of cocoa are complex and 
multifaceted.

We expect that these efforts, together 
with those of our stakeholders and peers, 
will accelerate the change we all seek 
and help to ensure a more robust, 
long-term and sustainably sourced supply 
of cocoa for years to come.

Cocoa, cultivated in more 
than 50 countries, grows best 
in the climactic conditions 
found within approximately 
ten degrees north and south 
of the equator.

addressing child labor

Many cocoa-growing communities 
are located in remote and often 
difficult-to-access areas. Children are 
often involved in daily household 
chores and farming activities, some 
of which may be considered ap-
propriate, while others may be inap-
propriate for school-aged children. 
Determining whether children are 
involved in inappropriate child labor 
is a laborious and complex task.
The relevant international child 
labor-standards are defined by the 
International Labor Organization 
(ILO) Convention 138 & 182 (ILO is 
part of the United Nations). To put 
these standards into practical terms 
for cocoa farming:
•  It is appropriate for children to help 
with chores on the family farm.
•  Children should not be kept from 
school to work on the farm.
•  Children should not carry heavy 
loads that harm their physical 
development.
•  Children should not be present on 
the farm while farm chemicals are 
applied.
•  Young children, generally consid-
ered to be under 14 years of age, 
should not use sharp implements.
•  Trafficking of children or forcing 
children to work are included 
among the Worst Forms of Child 
Labor (WFCL).
Working with many public and 
private partners, The Hershey 
Company is committed to eliminat-
ing the worst forms of child labor in 
cocoa-producing regions.

a broad-based approach
over the past two years, we have made 
important strides in developing and 
implementing a strategy for responsible 
sourcing of all of our materials, giving 
particular attention to cocoa sourcing. 
our broad-based, multilateral approach 
to cocoa sourcing stems from our belief 
that the most effective approach to 
addressing the many issues around cocoa 
sourcing is to help small-scale cocoa 
farmers increase both yields and quality.

In short, we seek to promote better 
productivity and a better life for cocoa 
farmers through four interrelated 
approaches:

H
Leading on-the-ground programs that pro-
vide cocoa farmers with education, tools  
and technology to raise their yields, the  
quality of their products and, accordingly, 
their incomes;
 
Forming alliances and partnerships with 
key stakeholders—governments, NGOs, and 
civil-society and standards organizations—to 
identify opportunities and implement high-
impact programs to support cocoa-farming 
communities;

Supporting research into improving the 
overall quality and productivity of cocoa 
farming; and

Working with suppliers to raise and 
adhere to standards.

Designed for flexibility, our strategy has 
evolved rapidly over the past several 
years and is likely to continue to do so.

  CocoaLink: Connecting Cocoa 
Communities™
In July 2011 we launched CocoaLink™, a 
first-of-its kind program that uses mobile 
technology to deliver practical—and 
critical—agricultural and social training 
to rural cocoa farmers. 

CocoaLink™ is available to any cocoa 
farmer with access to a mobile phone; 
currently 70 percent of ghanaians have 
mobile phones. Through a mobile phone 
application that provides for the delivery 
of voice and text messages delivered in 
their local language (Twi) or english, 
participating cocoa farmers can request 
and receive—at no charge—actionable 
information about good farming prac-
tices, farm safety, child and forced labor, 
family health, crop disease prevention, 
post-harvest production and crop 
marketing. They can use this information 

to increase crop yields and quality and, in 
turn, incomes. The objective in raising 
both incomes and awareness of good 
labor practices is to ultimately reduce—if 
not eliminate—the participants’ depen-
dence on child and forced labor.

CocoaLink™ is funded entirely by The 
hershey Company and developed and 
implemented in partnership with the 
World Cocoa Foundation and the ghana 
Cocoa Board. CocoaLink™ is the first 
corporate program endorsed by the U.s. 
Department of Labor as part of its $17 
million Framework of action to combat 
the worst forms of child labor in West 
africa, a program in which hershey is 
also a partner and a sponsor.

We estimate that 25,000 ghanaian 
farmers will enroll in CocoaLink™ by the 
end of 2012.

central cocoa region. source Trust, a UK 
nonprofit organization, is dedicated to 
helping farmers improve their livelihoods 
through better crop yields and quality 
through sustainable farming practices.

The program, which launched in march 
2012, will involve more than 5,000 
cocoa-farming community members, in 
addition to more than 1,000 farm 
families. The goal of hershey Learn to 
grow™ program is to double productivity 
yield and farmer income over the next 
four years.

  Supporting the ILO’s IPEC Program to 
combat child labor
In 2011, hershey began participating in a 
public-private partnership with the U.s. 
Department of Labor, which supports the 
International Labour organisation (ILo) 
with seven other industry companies to 
combat child labor in cocoa-growing  
communities in ghana and Côte d’Ivoire, 
the world’s largest cocoa producers, 
which, together, account for 60 percent 
of global production.

Together, the eight companies will fund a 
$2 million initiative in support of the ILo’s 
International program on the elimination 
of Child Labor (IpeC), whose goal is to 
eliminate the worst forms of child labor, 
as defined by the ILo, by 2016.

 West Africa Cocoa Livelihoods Program
In partnership with the Bill and melinda 
gates Foundation, hershey and industry 
peers are investing in a $40 million, 
five-year program, organized and 
implemented with the World Cocoa 
Foundation, that seeks to significantly 
improve the lives of approximately 
200,000 cocoa farmers and their families 
in Cote d’Ivoire, ghana, nigeria, Camer-
oon and Liberia. The program will 
promote socially and economically 
sustainable farming by improving 
farmers’ production methods, market 
access and business skills.

	More about this program

Over the past ten years,  
better farming practices have 
helped to increase school 
attendance in Ghana by 25%. 
These improvements are due, 
in large part, to significant 
investments by Hershey, its 
industry peers, the Ghanaian 
government and NGOs such 
as the Gates Foundation and 
the World Cocoa Foundation.

 New certification programs
We believe that certification of our cocoa 
is one of several ways to assist cocoa-
farming communities in moving toward 
more profitable farming as well as 
toward a more sustainable supply of 
cocoa. In 2012, we will begin offering 
consumers certified options among  
our products.

In 2011, we began an initiative, an-
nounced in January 2012, to certify the 
cocoa used in our hershey’s Bliss® line of 
premium chocolates in partnership with 
the rainforest alliance. In addition, 
hershey and the rainforest alliance will 
work with farmers to improve long-
standing agricultural practices and help 
them prepare for the future.

For example, hershey and the rainforest 
alliance will collaborate to provide cocoa 
farmers with training to help them curb 
their contribution to global climate 

change while adapting to its impacts. 
The rainforest alliance trains farmers on 
the proper selection of native shade tree 
varieties to create an environment more 
conducive to the healthy growth of 
cocoa trees. as part of an overall strategy 
to eliminate child and forced labor, the 
rainforest alliance’s auditors will help to 
assure that no children are employed 
illegally in farms supplying certified beans 
to hershey, while the organization’s 
wider training program, in coordination 
with the government and industry, will 
help build the awareness needed to keep 
children in school.

In addition, by midyear 2012, Dagoba® 
organic Chocolate will begin producing 
its entire line of UsDa Certified organic 
chocolate products with cocoa beans 
from rainforest alliance Certified™ farms.

a coalition to combat Buruli ulcer in West africa

Buruli ulcer is a debilitating 
infectious disease endemic to West 
Africa that affects people who  
live in remote, rural areas in West 
African countries—including 
cocoa-farming communities— 
and, without early detection and 
treatment, can lead to permanent 
disfiguration and disability.

Hershey believes that the worst 
cases of Buruli ulcer can be 
significantly reduced through 
awareness, early treatment  
and increased resources for the 
medical community.

In 2011, The Hershey Company, 
together with several other civil 
society organizations, companies,  
and academic institutions, 
founded the global Buruli Ulcer 
2020 Alliance, which is committed 
to reducing the spread and impact 
of Buruli Ulcer. The alliance will 
undertake, over the next several 
years, concrete actions to promote 
and facilitate early detection and 
early treatment of the disease.

The alliance will focus its efforts 
initially on Ghana, Benin and 
Côte D’Ivoire, with the intent to 
reach most of West Africa.

 Mapping the cocoa genome
In 2010, hershey, together with several other research and 
science organizations, provided funding for a team of scientists 
from pennsylvania state University and 18 other institu-
tions world-wide to decode the cocoa genome.

The scientists have sequenced and assembled the Dna of 
a cocoa variety found in the wild recesses of the rainforest. In 
addition to identifying the genetic pathways that are important 
in determining chocolate’s quality and flavor, the scientists have 
identified hundreds of genes that are potentially involved in 
pathogen and insect resistance.

This research at once helps to enhance understanding of how 
cocoa genes are assembled while also helping cocoa breeders 
create new, flavorful varieties of cocoa trees best suited to 
particular cocoa-growing regions.

 Mexico Cocoa Project
 
H   
 
since 2001, the mexico cocoa crop—and the livelihoods of 
approximately 37,000 cocoa farmers and their families—have 
been impacted by a variety of factors: the age of many cocoa 
farms, poor agricultural practices and the spread of disease. In 
response, hershey, together with several regional partners, 
including ecom Cocoa and the Chiapas state government, has 
committed to investing $2.8 million over the next 10 years in 
the mexico Cocoa project, a new program designed to revital-
ize cocoa growing in southern mexico. The program—which 
includes the good agricultural practices Training program, 
adaptation of the disease-resistant material (developed by 
CaTIe, a cocoa research organization based in Costa rica) to 
mexico, evaluation of local varieties (recommended by InIFap) 
and the renewal of 1,000 hectares of farmland—is designed to 
double family incomes and improve livelihoods of mexico 
cocoa farmers, and contribute to the worldwide supply of 
sustainable cocoa.

“ We have many limitations, as most 
farms are 30 to 40 years old. When 
moniliasis arrived, it reduced our 
yields, and some producers suffered 
a complete loss. We are ready to 
return to our farms, plant new trees 
and, through technical assistance, 
revive the cocoa crop to what it was 
many years ago.”
  —  Velsar Aguirre Alvarado from Huixtla, Chiapas

dagoba sourcing high-quality 
cocoa from Peru

In 2010, Dagoba®, our organic 
chocolate brand, partnered with 
Romex and Mitsubishi International 
Corporation to create a direct- 
sourcing model to secure a sustain-
able supply of high-quality cocoa 
from Peru. Through this program, 
on-the-ground staff work closely 
with Peruvian cocoa farmers to 
improve agriculture and post-harvest 
techniques. We are making direct 
investments in building tree 
nurseries and centers to help 
improve production and yields. The 
seeds planted in the new nurseries 
will be from cocoa trees selected by 
the farmers for high yields and 
strong disease resistance.

When the harvest is ready, Hershey 
will purchase all of the cocoa 
produced by this community.

EnvironmEntenvironmental issues, and our efforts to 
address them, require engagement with 
many of our stakeholders. Through our 
analysis of engagement priorities, we 
determined that the issues of primary 
concern to our stakeholders and our 
company are sustainable agriculture, 
biodiversity, forestry product manage-
ment, soil health, sourcing sustainable 
palm oil and sustainability certifications 
for raw materials. We discuss most of 
these issues in this section and in the 
marketplace section of this report. We 
are also working to better understand 
and address several other important issue 
categories across our operations:

environmental focus areas
Efficient business operations: Im-
proving efficiencies and using technol-
ogies to reduce energy use and emis-
sions, manage water use, and reduce 
waste in our operations and facilities.

Water availability and quality. These 
are increasingly important and urgent 
issues the world over, and we are working 
to gain a better understanding of our 
impacts on water supplies in the areas in 
which we operate. Beginning in 2012, we 
will conduct comprehensive water audits 
at our facilities. We are also dedicated to 
engaging our workforce on this issue and 
raising awareness through initiatives such 
as the 2012 one hershey earth Day event 
and campaign, which focuses on water.

Waste generation in our own opera-
tions and within our first-tier suppliers.  
This is an area in which we’ve set and  
met numerous goals, particularly relating 
to zero-waste-to-landfill operations, and 
to which we will continue to devote 
significant efforts.

Energy use and greenhouse gas 
emissions from our operations as well as 
the transport of our products. We are 
tracking the impacts of our energy use 
and are evaluating and implementing 
projects to reduce energy consumption in 
our operations on an ongoing basis.

Sustainable sourcing: Better under-
standing the impacts of our current 
inputs and how we can meet product 
requirements with more sustainable 
sourcing.

Sustainable design: Minimizing our 
environmental impacts through 
product design, focused currently on 
packaging.

Solar-panel canopy at 
Hershey's® Chocolate  
World® attraction.

learning together through stakeholder engagement
our efforts to engage stakeholders around our environmental 
priorities include activities to raise awareness among employees, 
manufacturing partners, suppliers, customers and consumers, of 
not only our work to improve our environmental performance 
but also how they can reduce their own impact. In 2011, 
hershey’s® Chocolate World® attraction installed “green Kiosks” 
at the entrance to the hershey’s® great american Chocolate 
Tour® ride to inform its approximately 3 million visitors per year 
about its solar project and vehicle charging stations as well as 
our company-wide fuel-, energy-, and waste-reduction efforts, 
water conservation and sustainable packaging programs.

Throughout 2011, hershey engaged with investors, employees 
and other stakeholders in an effort to better understand their 
concerns and to communicate its efforts. hershey has used the 
information gathered during these efforts to inform and shape its 
sourcing policies and strategy, as well as its approach to a range of 
other important issues. Key engagements in 2011 included:

•  Dow Jones Sustainability Index/SAM Group: We completed  
questionnaire and engaged on ways to improve performance  
and disclosures.

•  The Supplier Ethical Data Exchange (Sedex): Hershey joined in  
December 2011.

•  The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil: Hershey joined in  
April 2011.

•  We engaged with several certification bodies around the issue of  
cocoa certification and implemented a program to use certified 
cocoa in our Hershey’s Bliss® and Dagoba® products.

•  Carbon Disclosure Project: We reported, for the third year in a row, 
our GHG emissions to this organization.

climate registered status

improving operational efficiency: an ongoing effort
given the substantial energy demands of our manufacturing 
operations, we are continually evaluating and implementing 
measures to increase efficiencies. our efforts to manage 
environmental impacts in our own operations have a twofold 
benefit, as they increase overall operational efficiency while 
reducing energy use, ghg emissions, water use, waste genera-
tion and costs. 

among our energy-efficiency achievements in 2011:

 Installing an efficient heat pump and making significant 
lighting upgrades in our global shared services (gss) facility, 
which contributed to gss becoming a LeeD gold-certified 
space.
 Receiving rebates totaling $133,857 from our utility partners 
ppL Corporation and met-ed, Firstenergy Corporation for the 
upgrades performed on our gss and eastern Distribution 
Center, both located in hershey, pennsylvania.
Installing 1,092 solar panels on a canopy in the parking lot 
at hershey’s® Chocolate World® attraction in hershey, pennsyl-
vania and 182 panels on the roof of the Technical Center, also 
in hershey, which will enable us to reduce electricity con-
sumption by 318 megawatt-hours and reduce ghg emissions 
by 219 tonnes per year. 
 Installing a new energy management system in our midwest 
Distribution Center that will yield savings in electricity, gas 
and equipment wear.
Converting the boiler of our hilo, hawaii, facility to burn 
macadamia nut shells resulting from our processing.
Installing equipment in the wastewater treatment facilities at 
four of our manufacturing plants, which allows us to capture 
methane gas and use it as a fuel source. This reduces the 
amount of natural gas/fossil fuel required to operate those 
sites and reduces ghg emissions.

In October 2011, The Hershey 
Company achieved Climate 
RegisteredTM status by successfully 
measuring its carbon footprint 
according to The Climate Registry’s 
best-in-class program, having it 
verified by a third party and 
reporting the data on The Climate 
Registry’s website. By measuring  
its carbon footprint with The 
Climate Registry, Hershey can 
identify inefficiencies and potential 
for cost savings and provide real 
and meaningful data to customers 
and shareholders about environ-
mental performance. 

Hershey is piloting electric vehicles  
in its corporate fleet.

Together, Hershey’s environmental 
initiatives saved the company  
approximately $21.3 million in 2011. 
These include:
•  reducing waste in our operations;

•  using alternative energy sources, such as 
solar and biogas;

•   converting waste from our production 
processes to electricity; and

•  reducing materials, weight and fuel use in 
our logistics operations.

The results are an example of how our 
environmental commitments align with 
our core business objectives.

Reducing fuel use and emissions in  
our transport operations
We continue to make progress in our efforts to reduce our 
truck hauls, fuel use and vehicle emissions. The program 
centers on four key initiatives:
Project Overdrive. In 2011, we fully implemented our project 
overdrive initiative, begun in november 2008. Through this 
program, we maximize our use of carrier capacity by coordinat-
ing inbound and outbound shipments to our plants and 
distribution centers.
SmartWaySM. We have continued our partnership with smart-
Waysm, an environmental protection agency program designed 
to promote cleaner, greener, more fuel-efficient transportation 
practices. In 2011, 81 percent of our finished good shipments 
were sent via a smartWay certified carrier, up from 72 percent 
in 2008.
Warehousing and distribution partnership with The 
Ferrero Group. In october 2011, we announced a joint 
warehousing, transportation and distribution initiative with  
the new Jersey-based Ferrero group in north america. The 
goal of this alliance is to maximize distribution efficiencies, 
reduce fuel use and warehousing energy consumption,  
and cut greenhouse gas emissions generated in distributing 
products to customers.
Local shuttle transport program. We’ve improved the way 
we shuttle materials between plants by consolidating certain 
shipments and routes, leading to a reduction of approximately 
120 truck deliveries per year.

Water  
conservation
We are working to better understand the 
impacts our operations and supply chain 
have on water resources in which we, and 
they, operate so that we can manage them 
wisely and appropriately. 

Between 2009 and 2010, we conducted 
limited water-use audits at eight of our 
wholly owned plants, which identified 
some opportunities and generated basic 
recommendations for better conservation 
and water management. In 2011, we 
completed a more comprehensive water 
audit at our plant in stuart’s Draft, Virginia. 
We are evaluating the results of that audit 
and will use them to guide our efforts to 
develop a more extensive water conserva-
tion strategy and to identify opportunities 
to support implementation of our strategy. 
starting in 2012, we will undertake 
comprehensive water-use audits on  
all of our plants.

Managing waste: reduction and recycling 
another area of significant accomplish-
ment has been our work on zero-waste-
to-landfill (ZWL) operations. as of 
year-end 2011, our reese’s and West 
hershey plants in hershey, pennsylvania, 
had become ZWL operations, and our 
hazleton, pennsylvania, plant achieved 
that status as of February 2012. In 
addition, hershey’s® Chocolate World® 
attraction became ZWL in 2012, and the 
construction taking place to significantly 
expand our West hershey plant is also a 
ZWL project. 

our ZWL plants recycle approximately  
90 percent of the waste generated from 
operations and the remainder is converted 
to energy at nearby waste-to-energy 
facilities located in Lancaster and harris-
burg, pennsylvania. In addition, some of 
our excess ingredients and unsellable 
product is converted to livestock feed 
rather than sent to landfill. 

With these three ZWL plants and one ZWL 
attraction, we have exceeded the goal we 
set in 2010 to have at least one facility 
become ZWL by 2012. We have set a new 
goal to have five plants attain ZWL status 
by 2015.

In the summer of 2011, 28 members of 
the hershey Csr network volunteered to 
don protective jumpsuits and analyze the 
waste stream generated by employees at 
hershey’s corporate headquarters in 
hershey, pennsylvania. They found that 
66 percent of discarded items were 
recyclable. as a result of this exercise, 
hershey has implemented new paperless 
systems for some of our formerly paper-
based processes and conducted recycling 
education programs for employees. We 
will repeat this exercise in 2012 to 
determine the impact of these changes.

What does 
ZWL mean?

For Hershey, ZWL means that 
all routine manufacturing 
waste has been eliminated 
from landfill.

Cargill’s animal feed program helps our custom-
ers receive nutrition for their livestock that 
leverages our nutrition expertise. When we 
partner with companies like Hershey, we in-
crease our portfolio for our customers to meet 
their needs, and unsellable Hershey product 
gets a new life. It is a dual win.

 — Lindsay Ward, VP Global Sourcing  
and Material Solutions

The challenge, however, is that purchasing 
palm oil from rspo members does not in 
itself guarantee that all palm oil we buy is 
certified. Currently, most rspo member 
companies have committed to purchasing 
100 percent of their supplies from certified 
sources by 2015. That means that demand 
for certified palm oil will exceed the 
available supply as of 2015. given that 
challenge, hershey’s ability to meet its goal 
to purchase 100 percent certified sustain-
able palm oil will depend on the availability 
of supply in the coming years.

In 2011, hershey became a member of 
the roundtable on sustainable palm oil 
(rspo), a not-for-profit association that 
unites stakeholders from seven sectors  
of the palm oil industry to develop  
and implement global standards for 

some of the raw materials we use are 
agricultural products that, depending on 
where and how they are produced, can 
present challenges for us and our suppli-
ers. Cocoa production, for example, 
involves issues of environmental and 
agricultural sustainability that are linked 
with issues of economic and community 
development. We discuss how we’re 
addressing issues in our cocoa supply 
chain in the marketplace section of  
this report.

our supplier code of conduct and a 
number of our sustainability programs 
directly address sound environmental 
practices in the production and sourcing 
of what goes into hershey products and 
packaging. The supplier code was revised 
in 2011 to better communicate hershey’s 
expectations for suppliers to conserve 
resources; reduce waste generation, water 
and energy use, and ghg and other 
emissions; and to track the results of  
their efforts.

To learn more about our efforts to better 
understand and manage our supply-chain 
performance, please see the marketplace 
section of this report.

sustainable product design: focus on packaging
Case study: Hershey Mexico  
packaging innovation 

In 2010, hershey mexico redesigned the 
packaging of five sugar and spicy prod-
ucts sold in rigid plastic dispensing 
containers. The designs utilized less 
material to deliver the same quantity of 
product to consumers. Importantly, the 
consumer usage experience was main-
tained throughout the life of the product. 

as a result of these changes, pelon pelo 
rico®, Ice Breakers® and Frutas del 
puesto® containers sold in mexico use 
560,000 pounds less plastic annually. 

In addition, we are reapplying the learn-
ings from this work across our business to 
continue reducing the amount of material 
in molded plastic parts.

To learn and share best 
practices with industry peers, 
in early 2012 Hershey joined 
the American Institute for 
Packaging and the 
Environment (AMERIPEN), a 
group of 26 companies 
focused on sustainability in 
the future of packaging.

We regularly review and reevaluate our sustainable packaging 
strategy to identify ways to increase the use of sustainable 
packaging while allowing for flexibility in meeting customers’ 
needs. We are working on a process to define opportunities to 
reduce the amount of materials we use by, for example, optimiz-
ing seal sizes and implementing new technologies, and to 
identify and test sustainable packaging alternatives. We have 
also put into place a new labeling system that communicates the 
recyclability of all hershey paper and corrugated packaging. as 
of 2012, we have set three main goals related to packaging to 
achieve by 2016:

Complete more than 200 material reduction initiatives result-
ing in the elimination of 9,072 tonnes (20 million pounds) of 
packaging material.
Realize at least 80% recyclable material (by weight) in our 
packaging while encouraging and educating consumers on the 
recyclability of our materials.
Commit necessary resources to the evaluation of emerging 
alternative packaging materials and leverage enabling technolo-
gies to realize sustainability benefits globally where appropriate.

Our efforts in this area currently focus on packaging. We worked 
to develop new packaging goals, which we set in early 2012.

Reviewed several options regarding the sourcing of sustainable 
palm oil; selected RSPO as the best approach for Hershey. 

Reduced GHG emissions by 15.2% against 2008 baseline:

reduced electricity use through lighting efficiency, compressed-air 
system improvements and HVAC enhancements; reduced natural-
gas consumption through biogas recovery, boiler-stack-economizer 
projects and boiler control efficiency projects.

We reduced water consumption by 12% in 2011, falling short of 
our goal by 3%. Currently focusing resources on reducing the  
water usage of our chillers and boilers, which are present in  
nearly all facilities; planning comprehensive water audits in all  
of our facilities.

Complete waste audits of all hershey 
wholly owned plants by 2010.

Goal achieved in 2010. Audits identified opportunities to reduce 
the amount of waste produced and to divert waste from landfill, at 
all wholly owned manufacturing plants.

reduce waste generated by 15%* by  
2011 (U.s. manufacturing, 2008 baseline).

Reduced waste generated by U.S. manufacturing plants by 23%

production by 19% during the same time period.

Committing to purchasing only Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) 
certified office paper with 30% recycled content at our corporate 
offices.

Met 2012 target in 2011, attaining a recycling rate of 80%. Our 
West Hershey and Reese’s plants, both located in Hershey, Pennsyl-
vania, recycle 92.1% and 91.1%, respectively, of their waste.

as hershey expands globally, reducing 
environmental impact across our value 
chain will remain central to building  
a sustainable business. It will also  
enhance our competitiveness through 
innovation, cost reduction, reputation  
and brand equity.

In the first quarter of 2012, we set the

taking care: health, safety and well-being in the workplace

2011 safety performance

We have a long history of worker safety. In 
2011, we experienced our first employee 
work-related fatality in 27 years when a 
delivery-van driver was involved in a single-
vehicle accident. External authorities were 
unable to pinpoint the cause.

In our other key indicators, we saw the  
following improvements since 2010:

•  Total Recordable Incident Rate improved 
15%

•  DART (Days Away, Restricted, Transferred) 
rate improved 27%

•  Lost Workday Case Rate improved 29%

The safety and health of our employees are consistently at the 
core of our operations and an area of ongoing focus for hershey. 
We provide a safe workplace and—of particular importance to a 
confectionery company—promote healthy lifestyles. In 2011 we 
continued that tradition. our ongoing work to ensure that our 
employees are safe and healthy has resulted in a generally more 
engaged and more productive workforce. What’s more, a safe and 
healthy work environment supports creativity and innovation and 
improves business results.

ensuring a safe workplace
safety performance is a company priority, and hershey’s over-
arching safety goal is to consistently achieve best-in-class safety 
performance. all of our wholly owned manufacturing facilities 
and our office employees are represented by a health, safety 
and productivity committee comprising multi-facility, middle and 
upper-level management, as well as a dedicated safety director 
for manufacturing facilities. In addition, we engage with industry 
peers to understand and share best safety practices.

Through senior management support, the dedicated efforts of our 
entire workforce and ongoing implementation of best practices, 
we have achieved continuous improvement in employee safety in 
the workplace since 2007.

promo t ing  emp loyee  we l lness 

The hershey Company has a long history of promoting health 
and wellness for its employees, their families and the commu-
nity. This commitment is grounded in the principles set forth by 
milton hershey himself and is ingrained in our hershey values. 
We believe that healthy employees are more engaged and 
productive. The programs that we offer target prevention and 
personal responsibility for health.

The programs currently in place include two staffed fitness 
centers with multiple services available in hershey, pennsylvania, 
such as: 
• classes and educational offerings,

• screenings and fitness evaluations,

• personal training and massage,

•  fitness rooms at the Hershey Technical Center  
and at many manufacturing locations, and

•  a Fitness & Wellness Coordinators network,  
which has been in place at locations since 2004.

The Lifestyle returns wellness incentive program has been  
in place since 2007. our enhancements to the program  
and communications helped to increase participation from  

14 percent in 2008 to 23 percent in 2011. The program 
components for the Lifestyle returns program include comple-
tion of a confidential wellness profile; getting recommended 
preventive care, which is covered at 100 percent; and partici-
pating in a minimum of two recommended health and wellness 
programs. additional programs available to our U.s. employees 
include disease management programs that help employees 
manage chronic conditions, and health management programs 
that help them manage and reduce their overall health risk. In 
2011, we expanded our tobacco-cessation programs to our 
employees in mexico and Canada.

In addition to internal wellness programs, The hershey Company 
was integral in a collaboration among six hershey area employ-
ers to provide a variety of fitness, health and nutrition events 
for employees, retirees and families. The inaugural Chocolate-
town Challenge was held in 2008 and, since then, almost 
5,000 employees and their family members from the seven 
major organizations in hershey have been brought together to 
participate in events to promote physical activity, healthy 
eating, camaraderie and friendly competition in the community. 
each year, the organization with the greatest percentage of 
participants wins the Corporate Challenge Cup. The hershey 
Company won the first cup in 2008. 

engaging employees to get fit and stay well

We offer extensive worksite wellness programs 
at many of our global locations. These include 
flu shots and internally developed wellness 
programs that appeal to our global employees. 
Some examples of these programs include:

•  10,000 Steps: a 12-week program designed 
to help employees become more physically 
active by tracking the number of steps they 
take each day with the goal of 10,000 steps 
a day

•  Holiday Helper: a yearly program that 
provides tips on simplifying holiday tasks 
and maintaining healthy eating and exercise 
habits, along with healthy recipes for a more 
enjoyable holiday season

•  Weight Breakers: a team-based, 12-week com-
petition to see which team can collectively 
lose the highest percentage of weight

VOICES

“ The wellness programs we offer at the 
monterrey plant align well with our  
one hershey value and have been 
embraced by all the employees. During 
2009, the first year of plant operations, 
76 employees participated in holiday 
helper, and we had 290 participants on 
104 teams for Weight Breakers. We 
even added a Weight Breaker meal to 
the cafeteria daily menu. a total of  
782 participants have completed the 
program since 2009.” 

— Dr. Rafael Martinez,  
Fitness and Wellness Coordinator at Hershey’s  
Monterrey, Mexico, manufacturing plant

Walking to work

In response to recent studies showing that 
sitting for long periods of time is detrimental 
to humans’ health, Hershey installed sit-to-
stand desks in offices for employees engaged 
in a pilot study. Treadmill workstations have 
been placed in some common work areas and 
stability ball chairs are available in select 
conference rooms. 

Initial feedback has been positive, and Hershey 
is exploring the expansion of this pilot program.

Diversity and inclusion
at hershey, we see diversity and inclusion as levers to accelerate 
progress and results and, ultimately, contribute to a high-perfor-
mance culture. While as a company we place a high value on 
diversity, we recognize that we still have opportunities to attract, 
engage and retain a more diverse workforce.

To advance our diversity performance, we have put in place a 
diversity plan with an objective to realize greater diversity in our 
workforce by 2015.

hershey is also expanding its commitment to hire returning U.s. 
military veterans in 2012 and 2013 in recognition of the expertise 
and ethic they can bring to the company, as well as of their need 
to find opportunities to transition successfully to civilian life. In 
2011, more than 50,000 U.s. troops returned home from Iraq  
and afghanistan, facing a tight job market and numerous other 
challenges. hershey has employed a substantial number of 
veterans over the years, many of whom have gone on to become 
leaders in the company. a team from global operations and 
human resources is managing the veteran outreach initiative, 
which is also consistent with the company’s Csr and community 
values. The company has also created a Veterans’ Business 
resource group that is the newest of the employee affinity teams.

VOICES

“ Upon completing my career as a naval 
officer, I chose to join Hershey over other 
prominent companies for several reasons. 
Hershey is renowned for quality and is rela-
tively immune to economic recession. Plus, 
I’ve always enjoyed operations and The 
Hershey Company is immersed in opera-
tions. The operations parallels between the 
military and Hershey made it a smooth 
transition for me. 

As a veteran, I understand the sense of 
mission and strategy, which is common to 
both the military and to Hershey. Once the 
mission or strategy is properly presented, 
it’s been my experience that all partici-
pants come together to guarantee success. 
The most enjoyable part of the job for me 
is seeing finished chocolate products 
rolling off the end of the line. It’s a sign of 
a job well done and reflects the work of a 
myriad of people and skills coming 
together to make it happen.“

engaging employees
The hershey Company has more than 13,000 full- and part-
time employees worldwide, representing a broad range of 
personal and cultural backgrounds, values and aspirations.  
We believe that giving them a voice in how we conduct our 
business together—including how we meet our social responsi-
bilities—can only make us stronger, more successful and lead  
to a high performance culture.

In continuing to focus on being a knowledge—based company 
driven by insights, we have designed a consistent global vehicle 
to obtain employee input and perspectives. In april 2012, we 
launched our “many Voices. one hershey.” survey, which will 
allow us to engage and retain our great people, attract the

In 2011 and early 2012, we conducted a survey of employees 
at several manufacturing sites in the United states and mexico. 
We will complete surveys at additional sites throughout 2012. 
The purpose of these surveys is aligned with that of the new 
global employee survey: to learn our employees’ opinions on 
their work and how we can better engage our workforce. Fol-
lowing these surveys, we began implementing action plans to 
address the results specific to each facility.

We will conduct a full engagement survey every two years, the 
next being in 2014, and in the odd-numbered years we will con-
duct pulse surveys that provide a deeper look at specific issues. 

Employees for life. Each year Hershey 
holds a holiday dinner to honor its 
retirees. In 2011, 2,100 retired Hershey 
employees and their spouses joined 
Hershey executives for the dinner, held at 
Hershey Lodge and Convention Center in 
Hershey, Pennsylvania.

a long history of Quality through engagement
established in the 1980s, hershey’s Quality Through engage-
ment, or QTe, program serves as a global network for employ-
ees to connect with, appreciate and empower one another. 
Through QTe, employees recognize and reward peers and 
colleagues for initiative and performance that make a signifi-
cant difference in the workplace.

In 2011, hershey recognized several projects with its 2011 
executive award of excellence, including CocoaLink™, the rapid-
detection salmonella testing project and hershey Canada’s 2011 
United Way Campaign. The program also recognizes employees 
who demonstrate outstanding participation and dedication to 
the program, based on feedback from peers and managers and 
their personal business performance. In 2011, two employees 
from our mexico facilities received this honor.

engaging employees on environmental and social issues

We know that the quickest way to make 
progress on our engagement priorities is by 
creating enthusiasm among employees for our 
efforts. Our culture makes that easy. In just 
two years since we launched the Hershey CSR 
Network, a self-directed group of employees 
focused on various CSR issues, the Network 
has grown to more than 300 employees and 
continues to expand. In 2011, the CSR Network 
was responsible for initiating the Hershey 
Dumpster Dive, in which employees examined 
the contents of company disposal containers 

in order to gather data that could be used to 
reduce our waste stream; creating a commuter 
services program that connects employees for 
carpooling; and launching our Second Annual 
Earth Day Campaign to raise awareness of en-
vironmental initiatives within the company.

In 2012, members of Hershey’s CSR Department 
will visit each manufacturing facility in the 
United States to engage employees around the 
company’s efforts to improve environmental 
and social performance. We know we will learn 
as much as we will impart through this effort.

Compensation
In line with our goal to measure employee 
engagement and insights, we worked in 
2010 and 2011 to align our employee 
value proposition—the unique benefits 
and rewards of a career with hershey—
with hershey’s global business strategy.

our Total rewards program combines 
compensation with a generous, flexible 
benefits package. as explained in the 
brochure Working at The Hershey 
Company, employees based in the United 
states may select from a broad range of 
benefits, including:
•  comprehensive health and life insurance for 
themselves and their families, including 
domestic partners

•  retirement and investment plans

•  employee assistance and adoption programs

•  tuition reimbursement

•  scholarships for eligible employees’ children

We offer comparable, locally competitive 
Total rewards programs to hershey 
employees based in our operations 
outside the United states.

performance management
In 2009, we launched an enhanced 
performance management system as part 
of the annual review process, in which all 
salaried employees participate. Designed 
to drive employee engagement and 
ensure accountability, this system rewards 
employees not only for business results 
and strategy implementation, but also for 
exemplifying our corporate values: 
making a Difference, open to possibilities, 
growing Together and one hershey.

The strategic bonus goals for individuals 
align with and link to the company’s 
strategic plan. more particularly, employ-
ees with responsibility for managing 
issues related to hershey’s Csr strategy 
or particular programs are assessed on 
their achievement of goals related to 
those issues. In addition, our perfor-
mance management system makes it 
clear to employees that they are reward-
ed for their personal contributions to the 
company’s success. personal growth 
plans are also included in the perfor-
mance management system to help 
employees identify their own personal 
and professional goals and opportunities 
for development.

In addition, we also implemented a Career 
Development action plan process for 
selected managers. This is part of a 
two-fold focus on career planning and 
succession planning. If the process works 
well and achieves results, it will be expand-
ed to include all salaried employees.

training
at hershey, we provide a variety of 
training and development opportunities 
that encourage our employees’ personal 
and professional development.

We currently rotate selected employees 
through our international operations, 
matching high-potential employees to 
particular business needs as appropriate. 
Because we see this practice as a driver of 
innovation and retention, we are explor-
ing formalization of the practice as part of 
our renewed focus on talent management 
and development.

hershey University is our educational 
program that tailors its curriculum to our 
evolving business environment, offering 
both classroom instruction and online 
courses. In addition, when specifically 
relevant to their jobs, employees may be 
entitled to tuition reimbursement for 
associate’s, bachelor’s and master’s 
degrees at accredited institutions.

We began an effort to better track and 
monitor training hours and types in 2010. 
Led by our human resources department 
with input from the Csr group and the 
cross-functional workplace working 
group, we implemented a database and 
began tracking employee training and 
development initiatives in July 2011. since 
we began tracking, we have logged more 
than 56,000 training hours.

We recognize that training and develop-
ment are critical to attracting and retain-
ing key talent, and we are committed to 
improving our training programs overall.

CoMMUn it y

our commitment to communities begins 
with partnerships that support social 
and economic development and directly 
benefit our employees, their families 
and their immediate communities. our 
employees often magnify those invest-
ments by themselves, seeking to benefit 
communities through direct giving and 
volunteerism.

those at risk. We also contribute funds 
and products to a variety of other causes 
and nonprofit organizations, particularly 
in the areas of health and human services, 
education, civic and community programs, 
arts and culture, and the environment. 
hershey employees and retirees are active 
partners in these efforts, volunteering 
their time and giving generously.

In addition, as a global organization, we 
look to extend our community develop-
ment work to stakeholders beyond those 
directly involved in our business, for ex-
ample, in mexico and the cocoa-growing 
communities of West africa.

at the heart of our community efforts 
is the well-being of children, especially 

We are increasingly seeking to align our 
community development efforts with 
our corporate strategy while maintaining 
longstanding relationships that benefit 
both the communities in which we live 
and work and our company. We have 
recently updated our guidelines for com-
pany giving to this end.

We have established goals in three  
essential community categories:

Corporate philanthropy: We make 
donations of cash and products in  
countries across the globe where we 
have a presence.

Contribution of expertise: We make 
the professional skills of our employees 
available to eligible non-profit organiza-
tions and the communities they serve.

Employee giving and volunteering: 
We encourage and support the involve-
ment of our employees in a wide range 
of community-improvement activities.

How we approach community issues

Some of the ways in which we’re making a difference:

Health and human services 

Education

Civic and community

Funded several programs intended to 
reduce the spread of malaria in West Africa, 
including one by FHI 360 and another that 
leverages our own CocoaLink mobile mes-
saging system.

Continued our support for the Children’s 
Burn Center in Guadalajara, Mexico.

Contributed $50,000 to the Central Pennsyl-
vania Food Bank’s capital campaign as part 
of a five-year, $250,000 pledge to support 
warehouse expansion, increased efficiency, 
and the creation of a community kitchen 
to provide nutrition education to member 
pantries and school-age children.

 Purchased an infusion pump and eight suc-
tion pumps—critical technology for infant 
care—for the National Children’s Hospital 
in Manila, a government establishment that 
aims to provide best-in-class medical services 
to underserved children for little or no cost. 

Announced a partnership with Harrisburg 
University of Science and Technology to 
develop a sensory science and consumer 
research program where the University will 
conduct consumer taste tests on confection-
ery products, providing Hershey with valu-
able insights and university students with 
real-world laboratory experience.

 Partnered with the Academy of Art Univer-
sity in San Francisco, California, to create 
a $20,000 Hershey Scholarship for Design 
Excellence, mentor students in the Packag-
ing Design program, and launch a challenge 
that will lead to two student designs being 
used for Hershey’s national Valentine’s Day 
2013 packaging.

 Robinson plant employees collected more 
than 50 bags of donated school supplies  
for the annual United Way “Stuff the Bus” 
campaign, which directly benefits under-
served children.

Donated the company’s Fourier-transform 
infrared spectrometer to the Penn Museum, 
where it will be used to study foods, bever-
ages and chemical compounds from ancient 
civilizations.

Contributed $50,000 to the American Red 
Cross of Susquehanna Valley, Pennsylvania, 
for disaster preparedness.

Culture and arts

Contributed $1 million to a children’s 
museum in Arkansas in 2011 and more 
than $250,000 to other education and arts 
programs for children and families.

Environmental

Contributed $20,000 to New Birth of Free-
dom Council and Boy Scouts of America in 
support of the water system replacement 
project at Hidden Valley Scout Reservation.

In selecting initiatives and causes to 
support, we prioritize the needs of 
communities in which the company 
employs a substantial number of people as 
well as programs and institutions reason-
ably related to the company’s business 
purposes and needs, while continuing to 
consider the broader needs of society. The 
criteria against which we measure funding 
applicants include alignment with our 
corporate mission, fit with our geographic 
footprint, actual or potential employee 
involvement, and the proposed scope and 
impact of the program.

We are also taking a more results-oriented 
approach to both our giving and volun-
teer efforts, working to measure the value 
of the donations of our expertise, the time 
our employees spend volunteering, and 
the results of our work with programs 
such as those of the United Way and our 
own project Fellowship.

stakeholder engagement
our community work centers on stake-
holder engagement: understanding and 
addressing, through contributions of time, 
money and expertise, a community’s most 
pressing needs. many of hershey’s employ-
ees serve on boards of local organizations, 
and employees volunteer in the communi-
ties in which they live. Though much of 
the engagement is informal, we are under-
taking a more formalized stakeholder-
engagement effort in 2012 that will 
deepen our understanding of our impacts 
on the areas we serve and inform our 
work with our local communities.

Corporate philanthropy
The following are some of the key 
In 2011, hershey donated more than 
activities hershey supported through its 
$9.1 million in cash and products to 
philanthropic causes, representing  
corporate giving program in 2011: 
1.44 percent of pre-tax income. our cash 
donations increased by 28 percent over 
the previous year. We are also working to 
expand upon the corporate contribution 
grant agreements we approved in 2010 
for China, India, the philippines and Brazil. 
In 2011, we met our current goal to 
provide philanthropic funding to all coun-
tries where we have operations by 2012.

United Way Worldwide provided a 
grant to the philippine Business for  
social progress on behalf of The hershey 
Company to fund the creation of a 
simulation room in elsie gaches Village 
where residents can be trained in work-
place skills and household tasks that  
can, eventually, allow them to live more 
independently. The Village, which houses 
more than 600 developmentally disabled 
children and adults, is the only government 
residential care facility in the philippines.

In partnership with Nike’s Reuse-a-Shoe 
program, we developed and donated an 
innovative new play area valued at 
$50,000 in ogden, Utah, whose surface 
is made from recycled athletic shoes, and 

which contains embedded lights that  
can be used to play interactive games. 
some of those shoes had been collected  
as part of a drive conducted during  
hershey’s® Track & Field games meets 
over the past year. 

a $25,000 grant from United Way 
Worldwide on behalf of hershey made 
it possible for 150 children of migrant 
workers in China to experience a range 
of educational and cultural activities 
through the shanghai Charity Founda-
tion’s happy T ime after-school program.

We continued our long-term financial 
support of The Partnership at Drug-
Free.org with a new $75,000 grant to 
help build DrugFree.org’s bilingual 
resources for parents and caregivers, 
including the launch of a bilingual parent 
toll-free helpline (1.855.DrUgFree) that 
offers one-on-one live support from 
trained social workers in english and 

spanish. hershey has been supporting The 
partnership for more than 20 years, over 
which time the company has given more 
than $300,000 to sustain its programming. 

hershey is supporting, through funding 
and contribution of expertise, a new 
distance-learning program that connects 
students in Ghana and Milton Hershey 
School. The program will educate 
students at both schools about cocoa 
agriculture and chocolate manufacturing. 
The program leverages video conferenc-
ing technology from Cisco systems and 
the curatorial expertise of The hershey 
story museum.

Contribution of expertise
In 2011, we met our goal to develop and 
implement a system to track the contri-
bution of employee expertise in the com-
munity. our employees provided more 
than 2,300 hours of expertise in 2011 
through services that included tax prepa-
ration, construction efforts and technical 
training. The difference between our 
donations of employee expertise and 
our employees’ volunteer efforts is that 
in the former hershey employees are, in 
effect, “lent” to other organizations and 
use the particular skills of their profession 
or job with hershey to assist in research, 
development and other activities. one 
such example is the hershey vice-presi-
dent currently on loan to the United Way, 
where she is applying her corporate ex-
perience to help with strategic planning, 
and to drive successful organizational 
development and management practices.

A swift response to natural disaster

In the aftermath of the floods that devastated 
areas of Pennsylvania in 2011, we donated 
nearly 36,000 antibacterial wipes to the Leba-
non County Christian Ministries with a total 
value of $385,000. These were distributed with 
the help of United Way agencies to assist fami-
lies with their post-flood clean-up efforts.

We contributed an additional $155,000 in 
2011 disaster relief assistance for victims of the 
tornadoes in Joplin, Missouri, and the tsunami 
in Japan, among others.

In the summer of 2011, 
650 Hershey employees 
put our national sales 
conference on hold to 
spend a day in the New 
Orleans community 
rebuilding homes and 
playgrounds devastated 
by Hurricane Katrina  
in 2005.

The mission of project Fellowship is to

of our published goals related to increas-
ing participation in key programs that  
we support.

The milton hershey school, founded in 
1909 by milton and Catherine hershey 
and located in hershey, pennsylvania,  
is administered by The hershey Trust 
Company, our largest shareholder. The 
school provides free education, housing, 
food and health care to more than  
1,800 underserved children of all back-
grounds from pre-kindergarten through 
12th grade. over the last several years, 
75 percent of the students have come 
from homes at or below the poverty level. 
more than 40 percent of the students 
have a brother or sister at the school, and 
the student body has an even distribution 
of male and female students.

Looking ahead, we will continue to focus 
on growing the project Fellowship pro-
gram and supporting milton hershey 
school through programs such as hershey 
honors authentic Business management. 

Hershey Honors authentic  
business Management
hershey honors authentic Business 
management is a partnership between 
The hershey Company and milton 
hershey school that provides real-life 
business applications to students as an 
educational and curriculum development 
tool. The 35-week course is taught to 
senior honors business students at milton 
hershey school, integrating core learning 
from classroom experiences and connect-
ing it to relevant corporate management. 
The curriculum engages 40 hershey 
personnel in on-site, interactive discus-
sions about their work, goals, real-world 
challenges and successes. at the end of 
the school year, the program students 
present their final projects to hershey’s 
experts and senior leadership, including 
the Chairman of the Board of Directors.

The program came about at the sugges-
tion of a hershey employee who felt  
that, in addition to the financial and 
social support the company provides 
milton hershey school students, there 
should also be an intellectual dimension 
to the relationship between employees  
and students.

The program has been very well received, 
strengthening the partnership between 
The hershey Company and milton 
hershey school, retaining 100 percent of 
the participating company personnel for 
the following school year, and seeing  
35 percent more students request admis-
sion to the class for its second year.

The Hershey Honors 
Authentic Business 
Management program 
received the 2012  
PRNews CSR Award for 
Workplace Innovation.

United Way Worldwide participation and donations
hershey has long supported United Way and its mission of 
improving access to health care, promoting self-sufficiency and 
strengthening families in the United states and abroad. our 
support of the organization dates to 1932, when it was known 
as the United emergency relief Fund. our first employee contri-
bution campaign took place in 1955. Today, our commitment 
remains as strong as ever, as demonstrated by our track record  
of providing corporate contributions, matching employee gifts 
and encouraging volunteerism. In 2011, The hershey Company 
and its employees and retirees together contributed more than  
$2.1 million to United Way Worldwide and its member partners. 
employees contributed more than $1.3 million, and the company 
matching gift totaled $850,000. We also contributed funding  
for global disaster relief through United Way Worldwide. 

employee engagement
one way in which we encourage our employees to participate 
in their communities is through programs like our Csr sales 
advocate initiative, a team of 55 field sales employees across 
the United states and Canada who are dedicated to honoring 
our company’s heritage by making a positive difference in their 
local communities. They help bring hershey values and tradi-
tions into communities across the United states and Canada by 
engaging with field personnel, organizing volunteer and service 
opportunities, and sharing their Csr successes with the entire 
hershey team. 

The Csr sales advocates plan volunteer events for the sales 
teams in their areas, coordinate donations to local organiza-
tions, help with local hershey’s® Track & Field games meets, 
fundraise for the company-wide United Way Campaign and 
communicate regularly with the Csr department at company 
headquarters in hershey, pennsylvania. Through the Csr sales 
advocates, we have been able to energize our thousands of 
field sales employees around our Csr efforts, communicate our 
Csr strategy to them and actively involve them in building on 
the legacy of the company.

In 2009, we set a goal of having our north american sales 
Team participate in 100 community events per year by 2011, a 
number they quickly surpassed in 2010. In 2011, our team 
participated in 137 events. We will work to sustain this level of 
engagement in coming years.

Children’s Miracle network participation and donations
For nearly 25 years, we have been a partner to Children’s 
miracle network, a nonprofit alliance of children’s hospitals 
across north america dedicated to state-of-the-art care, 
life-saving research and preventative education. Between 2010 
and 2011, hershey and its employees collectively donated 
$436,000 to this organization. Together, hershey employees 
and retirees have raised more than $3.6 million since 1985 in 
support of Children’s miracle network.

VOICES

supporting  
employee  
interests
“ Working for The Hershey Company 
has allowed me to receive signifi-
cant support for my personal 
passions and further the contribu-
tions the company makes to the 
scientific community. Over the 
years, I’ve been able to serve as a 
peer reviewer and editorial board 
member for many scientific 
journals, and as a volunteer faculty 
member and graduate advisor for 
several leading universities.

But the company’s support hasn’t 
ended there. Having two daughters 
led me to think critically about 
diversity as I started to see some of 
the issues they faced. And so my 
wife and I tried to do our bit by 
contributing to the Lebanon Valley 
College Chaplain’s office for the cre-
ation of a multicultural library that 
houses texts relating to diversity 
and works to promote diversity on 
campus. The dollar-for-dollar 
Hershey Company contribution 
match we receive through Hershey’s 
Higher Education Gift Matching 
Program has been essential in 
maximizing our impact. The 
company’s generosity is just one of 
the many reasons I have been 
happy working here all these years.”

This report covers our performance on our material issues 
and progress toward our goals and targets for our fiscal year, 
which is also the calendar year, January 1–December 31, 2011.

This is our second full CSR report. our first was published on 
september 13, 2010, and covered fiscal year 2009. We pub-
lished a 2010 scorecard Update, communicating our progress 
against our goals and targets only, on april 15, 2011.

We plan to issue a full report every even numbered year  
and to provide an annual update on the development of our 
strategy and our performance with regard to our goals via a 
scorecard in odd-numbered years.

Unless otherwise noted, this report covers the 2011 calendar 
year, which is also our fiscal year, and the operations of The 
Hershey Company, including hershey’s wholly owned opera-
tions and joint-venture operations over which The hershey 
Company exercises operating control. While we have provided 
information regarding our joint ventures and co-manufacturers, 
we report progress on goals/targets and profile and perfor-
mance indicators for only our wholly owned facilities.

There have been no significant changes from the previous 
reporting periods in terms of the scope, boundary or measure-
ment methods applied in the report.

We have not reported on some GRI indicators because  
we do not currently track the needed information. In other 
instances, we are not reporting on indicators because the 
information is proprietary, not material or not applicable to  
our industry and operations.

We adhere to the GRI Protocols where applicable and 
feasible, as our data-collection systems are still in develop-
ment. Where we decide to report items outside of the grI 
protocol, we do so to increase transparency, to support our 
“story” of commitment to corporate social responsibility or 
because the data we have does not comport to a particular 
protocol but is the best way we currently have of communicat-
ing our performance.

We choose data-collection methodologies based on the 
specific criteria needed to measure the progress against 
goals and targets. These include, but are not limited to, 
computer software applications (e.g., sap), surveys (e.g., for 
volunteer hours, employee engagement), gaap (generally 
accepted accounting principles) and manual data collection.  
In most cases these are actual calculations. If we make assump-
tions, we will note that that is the case when referencing the 
metric. For example, when we report our volunteer hours, we 
do so based on a mode of 2.

We have sought assurance for portions of our environmen-
tal data. a third-party assurance provider, sCs engineers,  
has assured the data that we reported to the Carbon Disclosure 
project and, in this report, for 2010 against the Iso14064-3 
standard. We are currently seeking assurance for the ghg 
emissions data we reported for 2011. Kpmg is our financial 
reporting auditor.

about this report
This report describes how we are listen-
ing to our stakeholders, learning from 
them, and acting on the issues of 
greatest importance to them and our 
company—what we call our engagement 
priorities. a common thread running 
through this report, linking our efforts, 
programs and performance, is engage-
ment with key stakeholders and with 
each other internally. We are communi-
cating our performance on more issues 
and indicators, and with greater transpar-
ency, than before. We are also working 
to track the results of our efforts so that 
we can report on these in greater detail 
in future reports and communications.

2.9 
 In 2011, our company underwent significant organizational changes. James p.

succeeding David J. West. In addition, we restructured the organization to
•  ensure continued focus on North American momentum,
 provide the experience and leadership to accelerate global growth 
• 
and innovation, and
•  anticipate and respond to stakeholder needs.
 our reframed operating structure reflects our focus on serving global markets. 
reporting directly to our president and Ceo, John p. Bilbrey, are the following 
officers:
•  Senior Vice President Asia, Middle East & Africa
•  Senior Vice President Chief Growth Officer
•  Senior Vice President Global Operations
•  Senior Vice President Chief Commercial Officer

ment, global marketing, the U.s. selling organization and Finance.
 our Csr group now reports to our sVp and chief growth officer to ensure close 
collaboration with strategy and Vision, Innovation, research and Development, 
and key stakeholder groups including customers and consumers.

 

 

 

Governance
4.1  
 
 The hershey Company (nyse: hsy) is a publicly owned C corporation. our larg-
4.2 
est shareholder is The hershey Trust Company, which currently holds approxi-
mately a 70% controlling interest in The hershey Company. For more informa-
4.3
tion about The hershey Company’s relationship with The hershey Trust 
Company, please visit our website.
 The day-to-day business of The hershey Company is carried out by our 
employees under the direction and supervision of president and chief executive 
officer James p. Bilbrey, who succeeded former Ceo David J. West in June 2011. 
The company’s board of ten directors, which includes mr. Bilbrey and is chaired 
by non-executive chairman James e. nevels, is responsible for governance of 
the company’s performance, strategies and major decisions. The board’s 
purview includes compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, enterprise 
risk management, the integrity of our financial statements and management 
oversight, including succession planning and compensation policies.
 W ith the exception of mr. Bilbrey, all of the directors, including the non-execu-
tive chairman of the board, are independent, as are all members of the audit, 

 

compensation and executive organization, finance and risk management and 
governance committees. For profiles of all current members of the board, and 
to read a detailed description of our Corporate governance guidelines, please 
visit the Investors section of our website.
 We define "independent" as one who is not an employee of the company. 
"non-executive" means a board member other than our Ceo.

Our relationship to the Hershey Trust Company
 The hershey Company's largest shareholder is The hershey Trust Company (the 
"Trust"). The Trust is the sole funder of milton hershey school (the "school"). 
Currently the Trust controls about 70% controlling interest in our company, 
making the students of the school our largest beneficial owners.
 Founded in 1909 as a school for orphan boys, the school is a product of the 
love milton hershey and his wife, Catherine, shared for children. Unable to have 
children of their own, the couple developed a profound and deeply felt concern 
for the well-being of all children, especially those less fortunate. Wanting their 
good fortune to make a lasting positive difference, milton and Catherine 
hershey founded the school and funded its operations.
 Following the death of his wife, mr. hershey donated virtually his entire 
personal fortune to the Trust to administer the school in perpetuity. The Trust is 
our largest shareholder, making the school our largest beneficiary. Today, the 
school is a coeducational home and school that is true to its ideals and remains 
focused on helping children. The school provides a free, world-class education, 
as well as meals, clothing, a nurturing home, healthcare, counseling and career 
training, to nearly 2,000 children in social and financial need. all of us are very 
aware that the school's students depend on our continued success in the 
marketplace.
 We are proud to help the school continue to grow, not only by building our 
business but also through direct partnerships with students and house parents. 
Various departments and plants host career days and tours, and many milton 
hershey school students work in internships at various hershey entities. 
Through our "project Fellowship" program, groups of employees pair up with 
student homes for mutually fulfilling and fun ongoing relationships. project 
Fellowship involves employees from our U.s. and international locations at 
many levels, bringing a global experience and strong role models to milton 
hershey school students.

 stockholders may contact the independent directors or the audit Committee. 
We encourage good-faith reporting of all concerns and prohibit retaliation for 
good-faith submission of a report.
 annually, we hold a stockholders meeting in hershey, pennsylvania. stockholders 
may communicate with the board audit committee in several ways, including 
regular mail, electronic mail, or by calling our investor relations liaison.
 If any employee owns stock, he/she can attend the annual shareholders 
meeting and provide recommendations or direction to our board of directors 
during the open forum.
 We have an organization-level work council in some, but not all, of our wholly 
owned manufacturing facilities. The work councils communicate on behalf of 
the employees to senior leadership of the company.

 other than mr. Bilbrey, there are no other employees on our board of directors.
 hershey encourages the reporting of ethics concerns, and a number of channels 
are available for stakeholders to do so. employees may use the traditional 
means of confidential conversations with a manager, a member of the human 
resources department staff or a member of the hershey executive team. 
Contact information is printed in hershey's Code of ethical Business Conduct, 
on the company’s intranet and on posters displayed at all company facilities.
 hershey maintains a Concern Line staffed by an independent third party. 
Individuals can make anonymous reports to the Concern Line through a toll-free 
telephone number or via a dedicated website.

 Directors who are employees of the company receive no additional compensation 
for their service on our board of directors. mr. Bilbrey, our president and Chief 
executive officer, is the only employee of the company who also served as a 
director and thus received no additional compensation for his board service in 2011.
 The board targets non-employee director compensation at the 50th percentile of 
compensation paid to directors at a peer group of companies representing our 
most direct competitors for director and executive talent. For 2011 compensa-
tion, the peer group consisted of 19 companies of comparable size to hershey in 
the consumer products industry. Information about these peer groups is included 
in the Compensation Discussion and analysis in our 10-K. each year, with the 
assistance of the Compensation and executive organization Committee and the 
Committee's compensation consultant, the board reviews the compensation 
paid to directors at companies in the applicable peer group and establishes its 
compensation in accordance with its target. Compensation includes:
•  Annual retainer
•  Annual retainer for non-executive Chairman of the Board
•  Annual restricted stock unit award
 Annual fee for chairs of the Audit Committee, Compensation and 
• 
Executive Organization Committee, Finance and Risk Management 
Committee, and Governance Committee
 Compensation for board members is not based explicitly on social or 
environmental performance.
 see also page 92 of the 10-K: The eICp provides for grants of one or more of 
the following stock-based compensation awards to employees, non-employee 
directors and certain service providers upon whom the successful conduct of 
our business is dependent:
•  Non-qualified stock options ("stock options");
•  Performance stock units ("PSUs") and performance stock;
•  Stock appreciation rights;
•  Restricted stock units ("RSUs") and restricted stock; and
•  Other stock-based awards.
 The governance Committee considers recommendations from directors, 
stockholders (including the milton hershey school Trust) or other sources. 
 occasionally, the governance Committee engages a paid third-party consultant 
to assist it in identifying and evaluating director candidates. The governance 
Committee has sole authority under its charter to retain, compensate and 

•

terminate these consultants. The governance Committee has established a policy 
that it will not recommend a candidate to the full board until all members of 
the Committee have interviewed and approved the candidate for nomination. 
 our Corporate governance guidelines describe the experience, qualifications, 
attributes and skills sought by the board of any board nominee. generally, the 
board seeks individuals with skills and backgrounds that will complement those 
of other directors and maximize the diversity and effectiveness of the board as 
a whole. 
 In reviewing the qualifications of prospective directors, the board considers 
factors it deems appropriate, including the candidate's
integrity;
• 
• 
judgment;
•  skill;
•  diversity;
•  ability to express informed, useful and constructive views;
 experience with businesses and other organizations of comparable size;
• 
• 
 ability to commit the time necessary to learn our business and to 
prepare for and participate actively in committee meetings and in 
board meetings;
 experience and how it relates to the experience of the other board 
members; and
•  overall desirability as an addition to the board and its committees.
 The board seeks individuals having knowledge and experience in such 
disciplines as finance, international business, marketing, information technology, 
human resources and consumer products. The board also seeks individuals who 
bring unique and varied perspectives and life experiences to the board. as such, 
the governance Committee assists the board by recommending prospective 
director candidates who will enhance the overall diversity of the board. The 
board views diversity broadly, taking into consideration the age, professional 
experience, race, education, gender and other attributes of its members.
 The governance Committee does not distinguish between nominees recom-
mended by stockholders and other nominees. however, stockholders desiring 
to nominate a director candidate at the annual meeting must comply with 
certain procedures.

 our Corporate governance guidelines provide the basic framework for the 
board's role in the governance of the company. The guidelines include the 
4.10
board's policies regarding director independence, qualifications, responsibilities, 
access to management and outside advisors, compensation, continuing 
education, oversight of management succession and stockholding require-
ments. They also provide a process for directors to annually evaluate the 
performance of the board.
 While sustainability and other Csr matters are not a standing agenda item for 
meetings of our board of directors, the Csr Leadership Council advises the board 
on progress as requested. The Council can also ask to be placed on the board’s 
agenda whenever it seeks direct guidance or alignment on an issue or project.

 

 

C SR   leAd eR SHiP   teAM
 In 2009, we created our global cross-functional Csr leadership team to establish 
 
a comprehensive Csr vision and strategy, coordinate resources, align communi-
cation, and identify improvement opportunities. our Csr efforts are organized 
into four areas: environment, Workplace, marketplace and Community.
 since then, our Csr governance structure has become broader and more 
diffuse, as responsibility for Csr planning and performance is increasingly 
integrated into functional roles across the organization. We have created seven 
global, cross-functional teams, each comprising senior leaders from different 
areas of the company, to oversee the components of our Csr efforts:
•  Community
•  Environment
•  Workplace
•  Communications
•  Marketplace—Cocoa Sustainability
•  Marketplace—Responsible Sourcing
•  Marketplace—Customer/Consumer
 These teams meet monthly and are overseen by our Csr Leadership Council 
(formerly Csr leadership team), which meets quarterly to review our progress 
on our key issues. The Csr Leadership Council comprises 16 executives and 
managers from all areas of the company, including the following senior leaders:

 We have formed three working groups—Cocoa sustainability, responsible 
 
sourcing, and Customer and Consumer—to deepen our understanding of our 
engagement priorities and to find ways to address them creatively and 
effectively. The working group that most directly addresses a particular issue 
takes ownership of that issue, while a separate Communications group 
facilitates knowledge sharing, idea exchange and communication among all 
working groups that have an interest or role in dealing with the issue.

 These groups meet once a month and discuss issues in depth, develop 
strategies for addressing them, set goals and targets, and are working on 
developing metrics and systems to track report performance. our efforts are 
ongoing, guided by two clear objectives. The first is to deepen our understand-
ing of the broader societal context in which hershey operates and our role in a 
complex and interconnected world. and the second is to continually and 
consciously evolve our governance, systems and processes to ensure that we 
make positive changes that meet key stakeholder needs.

Supplier Auditing
 We are exploring different approaches to auditing and/or tracking performance 
and progress on key issues among our suppliers. Currently, we conduct very 
few audits ourselves, and those that we do conduct are announced. We 
recognize, however, that the practice of announcing may not allow for accurate 
information during the audit process. We intend to have an audit program and 
criteria in place by midyear 2013.

Supplier Code of Conduct
 The hershey supplier Code of Conduct addresses supplier behavior on a range 
of issues, from worker safety and community well-being to fair labor standards 
and responsible environmental stewardship. We thoroughly investigate all 
good-faith claims of supplier misconduct or activity alleged to violate the 
supplier code of conduct or hershey’s Code of ethical Business Conduct.
 We revised the supplier code of conduct in December 2011 and are undertak-
ing a thorough review of its provisions with a view toward strengthening them 
and increasingly their enforceability.

 Immediate responsibility for environmental management at hershey rests with 
 
our environmental affairs team, led by the director of environmental affairs, 
who reports to our vice president of Quality and regulatory Compliance, who, 
in turn, reports to our senior vice president of global operations. Through our 
environmental stewardship working group, members of the environmental 
affairs department work in collaboration with members of the procurement 
and enterprise risk-management groups and global operations engineering to 
oversee the measurement and monitoring of our supply-chain risks, including 
environmental, up and down the supply chain. We are also working to set 
goals and develop tools for better understanding, measuring, and improving 
performance across our supply base.

 accountability for recruiting, workforce development and training, health and 
 
safety, global diversity, and employee benefits rests with the sVp Chief human 
resources officer. The company also has a director of global diversity. The 
efforts of the human resources area are supported by our workplace working 
group. Comprising eleven individuals from the areas of Corporate social 
responsibility, Quality and regulatory Compliance, human resources, 
operations, and Corporate security, this group is dedicated to understanding 
and addressing workplace issues. In 2011, this group influenced a set of new 
diversity and inclusion goals that we are rolling out in 2012.

 our ever-expanding Csr network currently comprises 315 hershey employees 
who lend their time, talent, and ideas to help us innovate and advance our envi-

volunteers who have given their time to causes, such as the United Way and the 
Children’s miracle network, that inspire them and The hershey Company.

 primary responsibility for the management of our community efforts rests with 
 
our Csr group, headed by our Vice president of Corporate social responsibility, 
who reports to the Vice president of public affairs. The group operates under 
the oversight of our Chief growth officer. The team collaborates with our 
community working group and other functional areas across the company, in 
particular the human resources and consumer affairs teams, to ensure that 
these key stakeholder needs and company-wide input factor into all key

 We take several approaches to enterprise risk management, such as heat 
mapping, situational assessments, raCI charts, sWoT analyses and competitive 
intelligence. We do not use the precautionary approach or principle.
 We regularly and routinely review issues as part of our enterprise risk-manage-
ment process. In addition, in 2011 we undertook a materiality analysis to 
determine our engagement priorities. Through this process we analyzed the 
views of external stakeholders as well as those of management. Through both 
our risk-management and materiality analysis processes, we identified our 
engagement priorities, those issues discussed in this report.

 We expect all of our people, from chairman to hourly employee to supplier, to 
 
act with integrity and honesty in each decision they make and each action they 
take. all directors and employees, as well as employees of our joint-venture 
operations, are required to abide by The hershey Code of ethical Business 
Conduct (the "Code of Conduct"), and all suppliers are required to adhere to 
the company’s supplier code of conduct.
 The Code of Conduct addresses a range of issues from conflicts of interest and 
antitrust to fair trade, sustainable supply chain management and workplace 
diversity. The Code of Conduct is translated into eight languages and can be 
found on our website.
 all directors and employees, including joint-venture employees, are required to 
undergo training in the Code of Conduct and annually certify their adherence 
to it. In addition, we also require employees who work in in areas with 
traditionally high exposure to corruption, such as finance and procurement, to 
undergo specialized anti-corruption training.
 The board’s audit committee oversees communication of and compliance with 
the Code of Conduct, while the company’s ethical business practices committee 
provides executive-level focus and support.
 hershey encourages the reporting of ethics concerns, and a number of 
channels are available for stakeholders to do so. employees may use the 

 

 

 

traditional means of confidential conversations with a manager, a member of 
the human resources department staff or a member of the hershey executive 
team. Contact information is printed in the Code of Conduct, on the com-
pany’s intranet and on posters displayed at all company facilities.
 hershey maintains a Concern Line staffed by an independent third party. 
Individuals can make anonymous reports to the Concern Line through a 
toll-free telephone number or via a dedicated website (www.hersheyconcern.
com). stockholders may contact the independent directors or the audit 
Committee. We encourage good-faith reporting of all concerns and prohibit 
retaliation for good-faith submission of a report.
 The hershey supplier Code of Conduct, which is currently a contract term on 
all U.s. purchase orders, was updated in December 2011. The supplier code 
can be found on the company’s website.

 While we do not have a local-sourcing policy, we source from local suppliers

wherever feasible. We consider cost, projected timeliness of fulfillment,  
past experience, material quality and safety, and in applicable cases, material 
certification.
 While hershey does not have a formal policy, the majority of the company's 
international locations are staffed locally. Upper management positions are 
filled with both local and globally sourced talent.

 The hershey Company does not own, lease or manage any operational sites 
that are located in, adjacent to or that contain protected areas or areas of high 
biodiversity. The company has no plans to acquire property or operations in 
locations that contain protected areas or areas of high biodiversity.

 The hershey Company does not own, lease or manage any operational sites in 
areas where habitat remediation has been completed or where habitat 
remediation is planned, or in areas that are actively protected.

 The hershey Company does not have a formal program or strategy for 
managing impacts on biodiversity, however, our internal environmental auditing 
program and our acquisition environmental due diligence program both 
contain elements for evaluation of land use and activities adjacent to properties 
owned, leased or managed by hershey, or for those properties under consider-
ation for acquisition or construction of facilities. Through these programs, 
impacts on biodiversity would be identified and managed accordingly.

packaging material, recyclable packaging material and use of paper packaging 
material certified by the sustainable Forestry Initiative.

 We invested $400,000 for flood recovery at our wastewater treatment plant in 
hershey, pennsylvania, and $75,332 for spill clean-up in 2011. This does not 
constitute our entire investment in 2011.

 We do not have a significant seasonal variation in employment numbers.
 We do not have a substantial number of workers (defined as contingent) legally 
recognized as self-employed in any of our locations.
 Benefits are not provided to contract or temporary employees; since contract 
workers are not hershey employees, it is up to their employers, and not The 
hershey Company, to provide any benefits to them. In general, part-time 
employees are eligible for our voluntary medical plan, the myWell-Being global 
programs, and the marsh voluntary plans. Continuous part-time employees in 
the United states have vacation and are eligible for the voluntary medical plan 
and the myWell-Being full program, and the employee assistance program. see 
also our benefits brochure.
 We operate both union and nonunion plants. We work to maintain a positive 
and professional relationship with all of our employees worldwide and, where 
applicable, with their negotiation representatives.
 as part of project next Century, production will transition from the company's 
century-old facility at 19 east Chocolate avenue in hershey, pennsylvania, to a 
planned expansion of the much newer West hershey facility. production from 
the 19 east Chocolate avenue plant, as well as a portion of the workforce, is 
being transitioned to the West hershey facility. While this change will lead to 
enhanced efficiency through new technology and greater automation, it will 
result in the reduction of approximately 200 positions through involuntary 
severance and another 300 through voluntary separation or retirement in 2012. 
 The company provided notice of more than 6 months to these employees and 
is working closely with them to offer transition plans with strong financial and 
benefit support. We also provide assistance in retirement planning, develop-
ment of computer skills, and résumé writing and identify outplacement 
opportunities with other companies.

 one hundred percent of our wholly owned manufacturing facilities and our 
office employees are represented by a health, safety and productivity commit-
tee, which includes a dedicated safety director for manufacturing facilities and 
dedicated directors for the offices facilities and sales team.
 our health, safety, productivity team comprises multifacility, middle and 
upper-level management.

 We follow the injury and illness recording and reporting procedures in 
accordance with national laws and regulations where we conduct business and 
in compliance with internal procedural requirements.

 In 2006, hershey created the pandemic response Team to develop and 
implement a response plan and protocols for the company to follow in the 
event of a pandemic outbreak. The team developed a comprehensive plan that 
included deployment of a pandemic website for employee education. The team 
also monitored the alert phases, reviewed various pandemic response protocols 
to identify gaps, benchmarked with peer companies and consulted with experts 
to ensure that we had an appropriate plan for our company. In 2009, the team 
was reactivated to address the h1n1 outbreak. The team made changes to the 
existing pandemic plan to ensure it was tailored to address the h1n1 risks.
 The team linked to community leads including Derry Township for the hershey 
area and to other local and federal agencies in other locations where we operate.
 The team also created prevention and risk-control programs which included the 
procurement and deployment of pandemic supplies for employees, on-site 
medical personnel and visitors globally. more than 2.7 million masks, more than 
7 million sanitizer wipes, 1,400 gallon bottles of hand sanitizer and 2,000 
individual kits for our sales force and remote offices were distributed.
 This task had a tremendous overall impact on the organization in terms of 
educating employees in prevention measures and emphasizing the importance 
the organization places on the health and safety of our employees.
 The pandemic response Team is just one of several teams trained to support 
hershey employees in dealing with various forms of diseases. should someone 
from our workforce fall victim to a serious disease, we have health services and 
emergency response teams (hearT) to support all our employees. We also have 
employee assistance program counseling and/or treatment programs in place.
 our employees do not have a high incidence or high risk of specific diseases 
because of occupational activities.

 The hershey Company offers standard personal leaves of absence and medical 
leaves available through the U.s. Family and medical Leave act, as needed and 
as a standard part of the overall benefits offered to full-time employees.
 The company offers career transition services and financial counseling if an 
employee's employment is severed. If applicable, severance pay is determined 
by the employee's years of service and annual base salary prior to termination.
 The company periodically offers workshops to help employees for retirement.

 Through our Insights Driven performance process, we actively survey consumers 
and hold focus groups concerning our products.
 Through our Consumer relations department, consumers have various ways of 
getting in touch with us to share their comments about our products or 
business dealings. There is a toll-free number printed on all of our packaging, as 
well as an electronic “Contact Us” form on our website. outside of our Insights 
Driven performance process, we do not actively survey consumers, broadly, on 
product satisfaction. We do monitor their contacts for trends and outliers.
 The Consumer relations Department sends consumers who contact us a 
satisfaction survey approximately two weeks after their interaction with a 
consumer representative. This survey is sent to every individual who provides 
the representative with an email address. (Because an email address is required 
in order for consumers to send an inquiry or comment to the company via  
our Contact Us pages, the majority of our consumer satisfaction surveys go to 
those individuals whose initial contact was via email. representatives ask for 
the consumer's email address during a call, but consumers rarely provide  
this information.)

 

 

• 

• 

 our consumer satisfaction survey asks the following questions:
•  Was your question or issue resolved?
• 
 How would you rate the knowledge of our Consumer Relations 
representative?
 Overall, how satisfied were you with the way The Hershey Company 
handled your inquiry?
 How likely are you to recommend our products to your family  
or friends?
•  Please feel free to tell us more about your experience
 We draw insights and make recommendations based on the interactions we have 
with our consumers including calls, emails, letters, and social media posts and 
messages. We provide these insights and recommendations to marketing, 
Quality, nutrition, public relations, packaging and Legal on a monthly or 
as-needed basis. our constituents then use this information to gauge the success 
of new and changed products, support business decisions, monitor product 
quality and assess consumer response to corporate issues. The specific content 
and key conclusions of these communications is proprietary information.

 In 2011, ThC experienced a breach in security of our hershey's Kitchen 
website, which allowed for the exposure of user data information. The 
company dealt with the issue swiftly and concisely, conducted a thorough 
investigation and reviewed the recipes on the site to ensure their quality. 
although we determined that no consumer information was compromised, we 
informed all individuals who were registered to the site and outlined steps to 
help consumers ensure security whenever using the Internet and email.
 no financial information was stored on the same server as our recipes. There 
were no elevated complaints related to this incident.
