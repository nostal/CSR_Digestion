THE SOLUTION
Social         
Environmental 
Economic      
Coffee Bean International® is more than a coffee roaster.  
Development      
We strive to be coffee with a conscience. We take an  
innovative approach at every point in the supply chain— 
from relationships with growers to materials sourcing 
to product distribution to waste recycling. And, at each 
point, we examine the challenges so we can make a 
difference. In our decisions, we are guided by our values. 
We seek balanced solutions socially, environmentally, 
and economically. Do more with less. And do it as a team.

In 2010, Coffee Bean 
International developed 
Project S.E.E.D., an 
employee -led initiative 
organized to create 
leadership in coffee 
sustainability, both at 
coffee’s origins and here 
at home. The team is 
comprised of members from 
every department in the 
170-employee organization. 

We pledge to develop 
strategies that link people, 
process, product, place, 
and profits, meeting the 
needs of the present without 
compromising the welfare of 
future generations. Through 
this mission, we commit to 
reduce waste, reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions, 
pursue renewable energy 
options, educate our 
employees and our 
community, unify 
stakeholders, affect 
positive social change, 
and foster creativity.

A Defining Moment 
Thank you for your attention to our sustainability report. This document is our first crack at 
communicating (to anyone who cares) our quantitative and qualitative performance in 
sustainability throughout the supply chain. Our hope is that you learn something about us 
and, more importantly, that you learn something about how we can all re-think our approach 
to business so that our collective impact on the environment is less, and our collective social 
responsibility is more. 

As we’ve gone about our business of carbon footprint measurement and reporting, and 
building programs to improve social conditions at origin countries, we’ve learned that there are 
no reporting standards, and that in this industry, like all industries, “greenwashing” is the norm. 
So without any reporting rules in place, we aim for total transparency so you can understand 
what we measured, and what we didn’t measure. And, we try to lay out our results in a way that 
holds us accountable to our hard-to-achieve goals.

In this document, which reflects fiscal year 2009 and 2010 (July to June), you can dive deep 
into specific initiatives grouped into two categories: Social and Environmental/Economic. Or, 
review our performance at a glance in our Sustainability Scorecard.

As of the time of this publication, we are very pleased with our results. Going forward, however, 
we know there is a lot of work to do. We invite you to provide us with any constructive feedback  
by emailing sbeaubien@coffeebeanintl.com.

Thank you,

Project S.E.E.D.

social
Coffee Bean International® encourages respect for humanity 
throughout the entire value chain. We promote fair, safe, and 
healthful environments within the company, within our local 
community, and beyond. Through our business practices we aspire 
to unify stakeholders (employees, customers, suppliers, peers, and 
shareholders) to affect positive social change and foster creativity. 
We believe our biggest impact will be a large-scale effort to improve 
coffee quality globally, which will improve the social equity of millions 
of coffee growers and increase the attention paid to critical elements 
of high-quality coffee, such as green canopy, natural fertilizer, water 
quality, and organic composting. (See page 8 for our Sustainability Scorecard.)

Internal
In 2009, we created a sustainability steering committee called Project S.E.E.D. (social, 
environmental, economic development). S.E.E.D. created sustainability objectives and a 
vision statement. S.E.E.D. works closely with Project VOICE (volunteers offering ideas and 
change for employees), which is literally the democratic voice of the employees. VOICE 
strives to build a strong corporate culture through on-site and off-site events. In parallel 
with the progress of S.E.E.D., we began the transition to become a World Class 
Manufacturing (WCM) site. The three principles of WCM directly support our sustainability 
efforts: elimination of waste, culture of intolerance to defects, and preventative 
maintenance to keep machinery running at optimal efficiency.

Local Community
As a company, we democratically chose the Raphael House as our “non-profit of choice.” 
Raphael House is a domestic violence agency dedicated to ending intimate partner violence. 
We support the Raphael House through quarterly donations and fund-raising events. 
Additionally, we donate coffee to several other non-profits, including street roots, a non-
profit newspaper that helps people that are experiencing homelessness. Our company 
grants employees one day off per to year to volunteer at a non-profit organization.

Broader Community
We have expanded our selection of sustainably grown coffees (such as organic, direct 
trade, and Fair Trade Certified™). Additionally, we are co-founders of the Global Coffee 
Quality Research Initiative, which strives to improve coffee quality on a global scale. We 
hope to increase consumer willingness to pay more for coffee to improve the quality of life 
for coffee growers. We are committed to improving coffee quality en masse and driving 
real, long-term improvements in how coffee is procured from origin countries. This year, 
we also funded the SCAA Sustainability Tracking and Reporting Tool (START), which will 
collect sustainability data for the entire coffee industry.

environmental & economic
Coffee Bean International® moved in September 2008 to a new facility, which is a repurposed warehouse 
that was customized around our core competency: artisan batch coffee roasting at scale. We are the first 
coffee roaster in the Northwest and second nationally to achieve LEED® certification for a roastery. In 
addition to the efficiencies of our LEED-certified building, we are proud of the massive reduction of pounds 
delivered into the waste stream and a reduction in our greenhouse gas emissions per pound of roasted 
coffee. Thanks to the guidance of the City of Portland Bureau of Planning and Sustainability and Climate 
Smart, we are moving in the right direction to lessen our impact. (See page 8 for our Sustainability Scorecard.)

We track our impact in three key areas:

Energy Reduction
We measured our carbon emissions in three scopes and have committed to take action to 
reduce them: 1) Direct on-site emissions; 2) Indirect emissions from our facility’s activity; 
and 3) Indirect emissions from commuting and suppliers. Our priority is to reduce energy 
usage. Toward this end, we installed two regenerative thermal oxidizers, which dramatically 
reduce natural gas usage and offer superior heat recovery characteristics. Additionally, 
we’ve changed light auto-on timing, rewritten plant shut-down procedures, and enforced 
company-wide power management settings to save electricity. Where we cannot reduce 
electricity, we have purchased Renewable Energy Credits (RECs) from the Bonneville 
Environmental Foundation.

Waste Reduction
One of our largest ecological challenges is the amount of waste generated by our activities. 
In the past two years, we have dramatically changed our waste ratio by shifting the tons 
away from the landfill to a recycling center or an industrial composting site. We recycle all 
of our recyclable material (cardboard, glass, metal, plastic, paper, wood). Through a joint 
task force, we created separation procedures in the plant and added an in-office recycling 
system. We met and exceeded by six percent the City of Portland Recycle at Work 2015 
goal to recycle at least 75 percent of our waste. We transitioned to recycled office paper 
and we nearly eliminated paper cups from our office area. And, through community 
outreach, we have found partners to repurpose all of our burlap bags.

Transportation Transformation
We encourage employees to explore alternative transportation methods, including biking, 
public transportation, and car pooling with the end goal of reducing cars on the road. Each 
year, we participate in a city-wide Bike to Work Challenge for the month of September. In 
2009, we met and exceeded the three-year Department of Environmental Quality Employee 
Commute Options (ECO) Rule that targets a 10% reduction in auto trips taken to the 
worksite.
